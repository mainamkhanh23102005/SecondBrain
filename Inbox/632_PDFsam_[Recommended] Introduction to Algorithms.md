17        Augmenting Data Structures

Some solutions require no more than a “textbook” data structure—such
as a doubly linked list, a hash table, or a binary search tree—but many
others  require  a  dash  of  creativity.  Rarely  will  you  need  to  create  an
entirely  new  type  of  data  structure,  though.  More  often,  you  can
augment a textbook data structure by storing additional information in
it.  You  can  then  program  new  operations  for  the  data  structure  to
support  your  application.  Augmenting  a  data  structure  is  not  always
straightforward, however, since the added information must be updated
and maintained by the ordinary operations on the data structure.

This  chapter  discusses  two  data  structures  based  on  red-black  trees
that are augmented with additional information. Section 17.1 describes
a  data  structure  that  supports  general  order-statistic  operations  on  a
dynamic  set:  quickly  ﬁnding  the  ith  smallest  number  or  the  rank  of  a
given element. Section 17.2 abstracts the process of augmenting a data
structure  and  provides  a  theorem  that  you  can  use  when  augmenting
red-black  trees.  Section  17.3  uses  this  theorem  to  help  design  a  data
structure  for  maintaining  a  dynamic  set  of  intervals,  such  as  time
intervals. You can use this data structure to quickly ﬁnd an interval that
overlaps a given query interval.

17.1    Dynamic order statistics

Chapter  9  introduced  the  notion  of  an  order  statistic.  Speciﬁcally,  the
ith  order  statistic  of  a  set  of  n  elements,  where  i  ∈  {1,  2,  …  ,  n},  is

simply the element in the set with the ith smallest key. In Chapter 9, you
saw  how  to  determine  any  order  statistic  in  O(n)  time  from  an
unordered set. This section shows how to modify red-black trees so that
you can determine any order statistic for a dynamic set in O(lg n) time
and  also  compute  the  rank  of  an  element—its  position  in  the  linear
order of the set—in O(lg n) time.

Figure 17.1 An order-statistic tree, which is an augmented red-black tree. In addition to its usual
attributes,  each  node  x  has  an  attribute  x.size,  which  is  the  number  of  nodes,  other  than  the
sentinel, in the subtree rooted at x.

Figure  17.1  shows  a  data  structure  that  can  support  fast  order-
statistic  operations.  An  order-statistic  tree  T  is  simply  a  red-black  tree
with additional information stored in each node. Each node x contains
the usual red-black tree attributes x.key, x.color, x.p, x.left, and x.right,
along with a new attribute, x.size. This attribute contains the number of
internal  nodes  in  the  subtree  rooted  at  x  (including  x  itself,  but  not
including any sentinels), that is, the size of the subtree. If we deﬁne the
sentinel’s size to be 0—that is, we set T.nil.size to be 0—then we have the
identity

x.size = x.left.size + x.right.size + 1.

Keys need not be distinct in an order-statistic tree. For example, the
tree in Figure 17.1 has two keys with value 14 and two keys with value
21.  When  equal  keys  are  present,  the  above  notion  of  rank  is  not  well
deﬁned. We remove this ambiguity for an order-statistic tree by deﬁning
the rank of an element as the position at which it would be printed in an
inorder walk of the tree. In Figure 17.1, for example, the key 14 stored

in a black node has rank 5, and the key 14 stored in a red node has rank
6.

Retrieving the element with a given rank

Before we show how to maintain the size information during insertion
and deletion, let’s see how to implement two order-statistic queries that
use  this  additional  information.  We  begin  with  an  operation  that
retrieves the element with a given rank. The procedure OS-SELECT(x,
i) on the following page returns a pointer to the node containing the ith
smallest  key  in  the  subtree  rooted  at  x.  To  ﬁnd  the  node  with  the  ith
smallest key in an order-statistic tree T, call OS-SELECT(T.root, i).

Here  is  how  OS-SELECT  works.  Line  1  computes  r,  the  rank  of
node  x  within  the  subtree  rooted  at  x.  The  value  of  x.left.size  is  the
number  of  nodes  that  come  before  x  in  an  inorder  tree  walk  of  the
subtree  rooted  at  x.  Thus,  x.left.size  +  1  is  the  rank  of  x  within  the
subtree rooted at x. If i = r, then node x is the ith smallest element, and
so line 3 returns x. If i < r, then the ith smallest element resides in x’s
left subtree, and therefore, line 5 recurses on x.left. If i > r, then the ith
smallest element resides in x’s right subtree. Since the subtree rooted at
x  contains  r  elements  that  come  before  x’s  right  subtree  in  an  inorder
tree walk, the ith smallest element in the subtree rooted at x is the (i −
r)th smallest element in the subtree rooted at x.right. Line 6 determines
this element recursively.

OS-SELECT(x, i)
1 r = x.left.size + 1 // rank of x within the subtree rooted at x
2 if i == r
return x
3
4 elseif i < r
return OS-SELECT(x.left, i)
5
6 else return OS-SELECT(x.right, i − r)

As an example of how OS-SELECT operates, consider a search for
the 17th smallest element in the order-statistic tree of Figure 17.1. The
search starts with x as the root, whose key is 26, and with i = 17. Since

the size of 26’s left subtree is 12, its rank is 13. Thus, the node with rank
17  is  the  17  −  13  =  4th  smallest  element  in  26’s  right  subtree.  In  the
recursive call, x is the node with key 41, and i = 4. Since the size of 41’s
left subtree is 5, its rank within its subtree is 6. Therefore, the node with
rank  4  is  the  4th  smallest  element  in  41’s  left  subtree.  In  the  recursive
call, x is the node with key 30, and its rank within its subtree is 2. The
procedure recurses once again to ﬁnd the 4 − 2 = 2nd smallest element
in the subtree rooted at the node with key 38. Its left subtree has size 1,
which  means  it  is  the  second  smallest  element.  Thus,  the  procedure
returns a pointer to the node with key 38.

Because each recursive call goes down one level in the order-statistic
tree,  the  total  time  for  OS-SELECT  is  at  worst  proportional  to  the
height of the tree. Since the tree is a red-black tree, its height is O(lg n),
where n is the number of nodes. Thus, the running time of OS-SELECT
is O(lg n) for a dynamic set of n elements.

Determining the rank of an element

Given  a  pointer  to  a  node  x  in  an  order-statistic  tree  T,  the  procedure
OS-RANK  on  the  facing  page  returns  the  position  of  x  in  the  linear
order determined by an inorder tree walk of T.

OS-RANK(T, x)
1 r = x.left.size + 1

2 y = x
3 while y ≠ T.root
4

if y == y.p.right

5

r  =  r  +  y.p.left.size

+ 1

y = y.p

6
7 return r

//  rank  of  x  within  the  subtree
rooted at x
// root of subtree being examined

 // if root of a right subtree …
 // … add in parent and its left
subtree
 // move y toward the root

The OS-RANK procedure works as follows. You can think of node
x’s  rank  as  the  number  of  nodes  preceding  x  in  an  inorder  tree  walk,
plus 1 for x itself. OS-RANK maintains the following loop invariant:

At the start of each iteration of the while loop of lines 3–6, r is
the rank of x.key in the subtree rooted at node y.

We use this loop invariant to show that OS-RANK works correctly as
follows:

Initialization:  Prior  to  the  ﬁrst  iteration,  line  1  sets  r  to  be  the  rank  of
x.key within the subtree rooted at x. Setting y = x in line 2 makes the
invariant true the ﬁrst time the test in line 3 executes.

Maintenance: At the end of each iteration of the while loop, line 6 sets y
= y.p. Thus, we must show that if r is the rank of x.key in the subtree
rooted at y at the start of the loop body, then r is the rank of x.key in
the subtree rooted at y.p at the end of the loop body. In each iteration
of  the  while  loop,  consider  the  subtree  rooted  at  y.p.  The  value  of  r
already includes the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at node y
that precede x in an inorder walk, and so the procedure must add the
nodes in the subtree rooted at y’s sibling that precede x in an inorder
walk,  plus  1  for  y.p  if  it,  too,  precedes  x.  If  y  is  a  left  child,  then
neither y.p nor any node in y.p’s right subtree precedes x, and so OS-
RANK leaves r alone. Otherwise, y is a right child and all the nodes in
y.p’s left subtree precede x, as does y.p itself. In this case, line 5 adds
y.p.left.size + 1 to the current value of r.

Termination: Because each iteration of the loop moves y toward the root
and  the  loop  terminates  when  y  =  T.root,  the  loop  eventually
terminates. Moreover, the subtree rooted at y is the entire tree. Thus,
the value of r is the rank of x.key in the entire tree.

As  an  example,  when  OS-RANK  runs  on  the  order-statistic  tree  of
Figure  17.1  to  ﬁnd  the  rank  of  the  node  with  key  38,  the  following
sequence of values of y.key and r occurs at the top of the while loop:

iteration y.key r
2
4
4
17

38
30
41
26

1
2
3
4

The procedure returns the rank 17.

Since each iteration of the while loop takes O(1) time, and y goes up
one level in the tree with each iteration, the running time of OS-RANK
is at worst proportional to the height of the tree: O(lg n) on an n-node
order-statistic tree.

Maintaining subtree sizes

Given the size attribute in each node, OS-SELECT and OS-RANK can
quickly compute order-statistic information. But if the basic modifying
operations  on  red-black  trees  cannot  efﬁciently  maintain  the  size
attribute, our work will have been for naught. Let’s see how to maintain
subtree  sizes  for  both  insertion  and  deletion  without  affecting  the
asymptotic running time of either operation.

Recall from Section 13.3 that insertion into a red-black tree consists
of  two  phases.  The  ﬁrst  phase  goes  down  the  tree  from  the  root,
inserting the new node as a child of an existing node. The second phase
goes up the tree, changing colors and performing rotations to maintain
the red-black properties.

To  maintain  the  subtree  sizes  in  the  ﬁrst  phase,  simply  increment
x.size for each node x on the simple path traversed from the root down
toward the leaves. The new node added gets a size of 1. Since there are
O(lg n) nodes on the traversed path, the additional cost of maintaining
the size attributes is O(lg n).

In  the  second  phase,  the  only  structural  changes  to  the  underlying
red-black tree are caused by rotations, of which there are at most two.
Moreover, a rotation is a local operation: only two nodes have their size
attributes invalidated. The link around which the rotation is performed
is  incident  on  these  two  nodes.  Referring  to  the  code  for  LEFT-
ROTATE(T, x) on page 336, add the following lines:

13y.size = x.size
14 x.size = x.left.size + x.right.size + 1

Figure  17.2  illustrates  how  the  attributes  are  updated.  The  change  to
RIGHT-ROTATE is symmetric.

Since  inserting  into  a  red-black  tree  requires  at  most  two  rotations,
updating  the  size  attributes  in  the  second  phase  costs  only  O(1)
additional time. Thus, the total time for insertion into an n-node order-
statistic  tree  is  O(lg  n),  which  is  asymptotically  the  same  as  for  an
ordinary red-black tree.

Figure  17.2  Updating  subtree  sizes  during  rotations.  The  updates  are  local,  requiring  only  the
size information stored in x, y, and the roots of the subtrees shown as triangles.

Deletion from a red-black tree also consists of two phases: the ﬁrst
operates  on  the  underlying  search  tree,  and  the  second  causes  at  most
three  rotations  and  otherwise  performs  no  structural  changes.  (See
Section  13.4.)  The  ﬁrst  phase  removes  one  node  z  from  the  tree  and
could move at most two other nodes within the tree (nodes y and x in
Figure 12.4 on page 323). To update the subtree sizes, simply traverse a
simple path from the lowest node that moves (starting from its original
position within the tree) up to the root, decrementing the size attribute
of  each  node  on  the  path.  Since  this  path  has  length  O(lg  n)  in  an  n-
node  red-black  tree,  the  additional  time  spent  maintaining  size
attributes  in  the  ﬁrst  phase  is  O(lg  n).  For  the  O(1)  rotations  in  the
second  phase  of  deletion,  handle  them  in  the  same  manner  as  for
insertion. Thus, both insertion and deletion, including maintaining the
size attributes, take O(lg n) time for an n-node order-statistic tree.

17.2    How to augment a data structure

The process of augmenting a basic data structure to support additional
functionality  occurs  quite  frequently  in  algorithm  design.  We’ll  use  it
again  in  the  next  section  to  design  a  data  structure  that  supports
operations on intervals. This section examines the steps involved in such
augmentation. It includes a useful theorem that allows you to augment
red-black trees easily in many cases.

You can break the process of augmenting a data structure into four

steps:

1. Choose an underlying data structure.

2. Determine additional information to maintain in the underlying

data structure.

3. Verify that you can maintain the additional information for the
basic modifying operations on the underlying data structure.

4. Develop new operations.

As with any prescriptive design method, you’ll rarely be able to follow
the  steps  precisely  in  the  order  given.  Most  design  work  contains  an
element of trial and error, and progress on all steps usually proceeds in
parallel.  There  is  no  point,  for  example,  in  determining  additional
information  and  developing  new  operations  (steps  2  and  4)  if  you
cannot  maintain  the  additional  information  efﬁciently.  Nevertheless,
this  four-step  method  provides  a  good  focus  for  your  efforts  in
augmenting  a  data  structure,  and  it  is  also  a  good  framework  for
documenting an augmented data structure.

We followed these four steps in Section 17.1 to design order-statistic
trees.  For  step  1,  we  chose  red-black  trees  as  the  underlying  data
structure.  Red-black  trees  seemed  like  a  good  starting  point  because
they  efﬁciently  support  other  dynamic-set  operations  on  a  total  order,
such
and
PREDECESSOR.

as  MINIMUM,  MAXIMUM,

SUCCESSOR,

In Step 2, we added the size attribute, so that each node x stores the
size  of  the  subtree  rooted  at  x.  Generally,  the  additional  information
makes  operations  more  efﬁcient.  For  example,  it  is  possible  to
implement  OS-SELECT  and  OS-RANK  using  just  the  keys  stored  in

the  tree,  but  then  they  would  not  run  in  O(lg  n)  time.  Sometimes,  the
additional  information  is  pointer  information  rather  than  data,  as  in
Exercise 17.2-1.

For step 3, we ensured that insertion and deletion can maintain the
size attributes while still running in O(lg n) time. Ideally, you would like
to update only a few elements of the data structure in order to maintain
the additional information. For example, if each node simply stores its
rank  in  the  tree,  the  OS-SELECT  and  OS-RANK  procedures  run
quickly, but inserting a new minimum element might cause a change to
this  information  in  every  node  of  the  tree.  Because  we  chose  to  store
subtree  sizes  instead,  inserting  a  new  element  causes  information  to
change in only O(lg n) nodes.

In  Step  4,  we  developed  the  operations  OS-SELECT  and  OS-
RANK. After all, the need for new operations is why anyone bothers to
augment  a  data  structure  in  the  ﬁrst  place.  Occasionally,  rather  than
developing  new  operations,  you  can  use  the  additional  information  to
expedite existing ones, as in Exercise 17.2-1.

Augmenting red-black trees

When  red-black  trees  underlie  an  augmented  data  structure,  we  can
prove that insertion and deletion can always efﬁciently maintain certain
kinds  of  additional  information,  thereby  simplifying  step  3.  The  proof
of  the  following  theorem  is  similar  to  the  argument  from  Section  17.1
that we can maintain the size attribute for order-statistic trees.

Theorem 17.1 (Augmenting a red-black tree)
Let f be an attribute that augments a red-black tree T of n nodes, and
suppose  that  the  value  of  f  for  each  node  x  depends  only  the
information  in  nodes  x,  x.left,  and  x.right  (possibly  including  x.left.f
and  x.right.f),  and  that  the  value  of  x.f  can  be  computed  from  this
information  in  O(1)  time.  Then,  the  insertion  and  deletion  operations
can  maintain  the  values  of  f  in  all  nodes  of  T  without  asymptotically
affecting the O(lg n) running times of these operations.

Proof   The main idea of the proof is that a change to an f attribute in a
node x propagates only to ancestors of x in the tree. That is, changing

x.f may require x.p.f to be updated, but nothing else; updating x.p.f may
require  x.p.p.f  to  be  updated,  but  nothing  else;  and  so  on  up  the  tree.
After  updating  T.root.f,  no  other  node  depends  on  the  new  value,  and
so the process terminates. Since the height of a red-black tree is O(lg n),
changing  an  f  attribute  in  a  node  costs  O(lg  n)  time  in  updating  all
nodes that depend on the change.

As we saw in Section 13.3, insertion of a node x into red-black tree T
consists of two phases. If the tree T is empty, then the ﬁrst phase simply
makes x be the root of T. If T is not empty, then the ﬁrst phase inserts x
as a child of an existing node. Because we assume that the value of x.f
depends only on information in the other attributes of x itself and the
information  in  x’s  children,  and  because  x’s  children  are  both  the
sentinel  T.nil,  it  takes  only  O(1)  time  to  compute  the  value  of  x.f.
Having computed x.f, the change propagates up the tree. Thus, the total
time for the ﬁrst phase of insertion is O(lg n). During the second phase,
the only structural changes to the tree come from rotations. Since only
two nodes change in a rotation, but a change to an attribute might need
to propagate up to the root, the total time for updating the f attributes is
O(lg n) per rotation. Since the number of rotations during insertion is at
most two, the total time for insertion is O(lg n).

Like insertion, deletion has two phases, as Section 13.4 discusses. In
the ﬁrst phase, changes to the tree occur when a node is deleted, and at
most  two  other  nodes  could  move  within  the  tree.  Propagating  the
updates  to  f  caused  by  these  changes  costs  at  most  O(lg  n),  since  the
changes  modify  the  tree  locally  along  a  simple  path  from  the  lowest
changed  node  to  the  root.  Fixing  up  the  red-black  tree  during  the
second  phase  requires  at  most  three  rotations,  and  each  rotation
requires  at  most  O(lg  n)  time  to  propagate  the  updates  to  f.  Thus,  like
insertion, the total time for deletion is O(lg n).

▪

In  many  cases,  such  as  maintaining  the  size  attributes  in  order-
statistic trees, the cost of updating after a rotation is O(1), rather than
the O(lg n) derived in the proof of Theorem 17.1. Exercise 17.2-3 gives
an example.

On  the  other  hand,  when  an  update  after  a  rotation  requires  a
traversal  all  the  way  up  to  the  root,  it  is  important  that  insertion  into
and  deletion  from  a  red-black  tree  require  a  constant  number  of
rotations.  The  chapter  notes  for  Chapter  13  list  other  schemes  for
balancing  search  trees  that  do  not  bound  the  number  of  rotations  per
insertion or deletion by a constant. If each operation might require Θ(lg
n)  rotations  and  each  rotation  traverses  a  path  up  to  the  root,  then  a
single operation could require Θ(lg2n) time, rather than the O(lg n) time
bound given by Theorem 17.1.

in the subtree rooted at x. Show how to update the f attributes in O(1)
time after a rotation. Modify your argument slightly to apply it to the
size attributes in order-statistic trees.

17.3    Interval trees

This  section  shows  how  to  augment  red-black  trees  to  support
operations  on  dynamic  sets  of  intervals.  In  this  section,  we’ll  assume
that  intervals  are  closed.  Extending  the  results  to  open  and  half-open
intervals is conceptually straightforward. (See page 1157 for deﬁnitions
of closed, open, and half-open intervals.)

Intervals  are  convenient  for  representing  events  that  each  occupy  a
continuous period of time. For example, you could query a database of
time intervals to ﬁnd out which events occurred during a given interval.
The  data  structure  in  this  section  provides  an  efﬁcient  means  for
maintaining such an interval database.

A  simple  way  to  represent  an  interval  [t1,  t2]  is  as  an  object  i  with
attributes  i.low  =  t1  (the  low  endpoint)  and  i.high  =  t2  (the  high
endpoint).  We  say  that  intervals  i  and  i′  overlap  if  i  ∩i′  ≠  ∅,  that  is,  if
i.low ≤ i′.high and i′.low ≤ i.high.

Figure 17.3 The interval trichotomy for two closed intervals i and i′. (a) If i and i′ overlap, there
are  four  situations,  and  in  each,  i.low  ≤  i′.high  and  i′.low  ≤  i.high.  (b)  The  intervals  do  not
overlap, and i.high < i′.low. (c) The intervals do not overlap, and i′.high < i.low.

As  Figure  17.3  shows,  any  two  intervals  i  and  i′  satisfy  the  interval
trichotomy, that is, exactly one of the following three properties holds:

a. i and i′ overlap,
b. i is to the left of i′ (i.e., i.high < i′.low),
c. i is to the right of i′ (i.e., i′.high < i.low).

An  interval  tree  is  a  red-black  tree  that  maintains  a  dynamic  set  of
elements, with each element x containing an interval x.int. Interval trees

support the following operations:

INTERVAL-INSERT(T,  x)  adds  the  element  x,  whose  int  attribute  is

assumed to contain an interval, to the interval tree T.

INTERVAL-DELETE(T,  x)  removes  the  element  x  from  the  interval

tree T.

INTERVAL-SEARCH(T,  i)  returns  a  pointer  to  an  element  x  in  the
interval  tree  T  such  that  x.int  overlaps  interval  i,  or  a  pointer  to  the
sentinel T.nil if no such element belongs to the set.

Figure 17.4 shows how an interval tree represents a set of intervals. The
four-step method from Section 17.2 will guide our design of an interval
tree and the operations that run on it.

Step 1: Underlying data structure

A  red-black  tree  serves  as  the  underlying  data  structure.  Each  node  x
contains an interval x.int. The key of x is the low endpoint, x.int.low, of
the  interval.  Thus,  an  inorder  tree  walk  of  the  data  structure  lists  the
intervals in sorted order by low endpoint.

Figure  17.4  An  interval  tree.  (a)  A  set  of  10  intervals,  shown  sorted  bottom  to  top  by  left
endpoint.  (b)  The  interval  tree  that  represents  them.  Each  node  x  contains  an  interval,  shown
above the dashed line, and the maximum value of any interval endpoint in the subtree rooted at
x, shown below the dashed line. An inorder tree walk of the tree lists the nodes in sorted order
by left endpoint.

Step 2: Additional information

In  addition  to  the  intervals  themselves,  each  node  x  contains  a  value
x.max, which is the maximum value of any interval endpoint stored in
the subtree rooted at x.

Step 3: Maintaining the information

We  must  verify  that  insertion  and  deletion  take  O(lg  n)  time  on  an
interval tree of n nodes. It is simple enough to determine x.max in O(1)

time, given interval x.int and the max values of node x’s children:

x.max = max {x.int.high, x.left.max, x.right.max}.

Thus,  by  Theorem  17.1,  insertion  and  deletion  run  in  O(lg  n)  time.  In
fact, you can use either Exercise 17.2-3 or 17.3-1 to show how to update
all the max attributes that change after a rotation in just O(1) time.

Step 4: Developing new operations

The  only  new  operation  is  INTERVAL-SEARCH(T,  i),  which  ﬁnds  a
node in tree T whose interval overlaps interval i. If there is no interval
in the tree that overlaps i, the procedure returns a pointer to the sentinel
T.nil.

INTERVAL-SEARCH(T, i)
1 x = T.root
2 while x ≠ T.nil and i does not overlap x.int
3

if x.left ≠ T.nil and x.left.max ≥ i.low

4

5

x = x.left

else

x
x.right

6 return x

//  overlap  in  left  subtree  or  no  overlap  in  right
subtree
// no overlap in left subtree

=

The search for an interval that overlaps i starts at the root of the tree
and  proceeds  downward.  It  terminates  when  either  it  ﬁnds  an
overlapping interval or it reaches the sentinel T.nil. Since each iteration
of the basic loop takes O(1) time, and since the height of an n-node red-
black tree is O(lg n), the INTERVAL-SEARCH procedure takes O(lg n)
time.

Before  we  see  why  INTERVAL-SEARCH  is  correct,  let’s  examine
how  it  works  on  the  interval  tree  in  Figure  17.4.  Let’s  look  for  an
interval that overlaps the interval i = [22, 25]. Begin with x as the root,
which contains [16, 21] and does not overlap i. Since x.left.max = 23 is
greater than i.low = 22, the loop continues with x as the left child of the
root—the  node  containing  [8,  9],  which  also  does  not  overlap  i.  This

time, x.left.max = 10 is less than i.low = 22, and so the loop continues
with  the  right  child  of  x  as  the  new  x.  Because  the  interval  [15,  23]
stored in this node overlaps i, the procedure returns this node.

Now let’s try an unsuccessful search, for an interval that overlaps i =
[11,  14]  in  the  interval  tree  of  Figure  17.4.  Again,  begin  with  x  as  the
root.  Since  the  root’s  interval  [16,  21]  does  not  overlap  i,  and  since
x.left.max = 23 is greater than i.low = 11, go left to the node containing
[8, 9]. Interval [8, 9] does not overlap i, and x.left.max = 10 is less than
i.low = 11, and so the search goes right. (No interval in the left subtree
overlaps i.) Interval [15, 23] does not overlap i, and its left child is T.nil,
so  again  the  search  goes  right,  the  loop  terminates,  and  INTERVAL-
SEARCH returns the sentinel T.nil.

To  see  why  INTERVAL-SEARCH  is  correct,  we  must  understand
why it sufﬁces to examine a single path from the root. The basic idea is
that  at  any  node  x,  if  x.int  does  not  overlap  i,  the  search  always
proceeds  in  a  safe  direction:  the  search  will  deﬁnitely  ﬁnd  an
overlapping  interval  if  the  tree  contains  one.  The  following  theorem
states this property more precisely.

Theorem 17.2
Any  execution  of  INTERVAL-SEARCH(T,  i)  either  returns  a  node
whose interval overlaps i, or it returns T.nil and the tree T contains no
node whose interval overlaps i.

Proof   The while loop of lines 2–5 terminates when either x = T.nil or i
overlaps  x.int.  In  the  latter  case,  it  is  certainly  correct  to  return  x.
Therefore,  we  focus  on  the  former  case,  in  which  the  while  loop
terminates  because  x  =  T.nil,  which  is  the  node  that  INTERVAL-
SEARCH returns.

We’ll  prove  that  if  the  procedure  returns  T.nil,  then  it  did  not  miss
any  intervals  in  T  that  overlap  i.  The  idea  is  to  show  that  whether  the
search goes left in line 4 or right in line 5, it always heads toward a node
containing  an  interval  overlapping  i,  if  any  such  interval  exists.  In
particular, we’ll prove that

1. If  the  search  goes  left  in  line  4,  then  the  left  subtree  of  node  x
contains  an  interval  that  overlaps  i  or  the  right  subtree  of  x

contains  no  interval  that  overlaps  i.  Therefore,  even  if  x’s  left
subtree  contains  no  interval  that  overlaps  i  but  the  search  goes
left,  it  does  not  make  a  mistake,  because  x’s  right  subtree  does
not contain an interval overlapping i, either.

2. If  the  search  goes  right  in  line  5,  then  the  left  subtree  of  x
contains  no  interval  that  overlaps  i.  Thus,  if  the  search  goes
right, it does not make a mistake.

For  both  cases,  we  rely  on  the  interval  trichotomy.  Let’s  start  with
the case where the search goes right, whose proof is simpler. By the tests
in  line  3,  we  know  that  x.left  =  T.nil  or  x.left.max  <  i.low.  If  x.left  =
T.nil,  then  x’s  left  subtree  contains  no  interval  that  overlaps  i,  since  it
contains no intervals at all. Now suppose that x.left ≠ T.nil, so that we
must have x.left.max < i.low. Consider any interval i′ in x’s left subtree.
Because x.left.max is the maximum endpoint in x’s left subtree, we have
i′.high ≤ x.left.max. Thus, as Figure 17.5(a) shows,

i′.high ≤ x.left.max
< i.low.

By  the  interval  trichotomy,  therefore,  intervals  i  and  i′  do  not  overlap,
and so x’s left subtree contains no interval that overlaps i.

Figure  17.5  Intervals  in  the  proof  of  Theorem  17.2.  The  value  of  x.left.max  is  shown  in  each
case as a dashed line. (a) The search goes right. No interval i′ in x’s left subtree can overlap i. (b)
The  search  goes  left.  The  left  subtree  of  x  contains  an  interval  that  overlaps  i  (situation  not
shown), or x’s left subtree contains an interval i′ such that i′.high = x.left.max. Since i does not
overlap i′, neither does it overlap any interval i″ in x’s right subtree, since i′.low ≤ i″.low.

Now  we  examine  the  case  in  which  the  search  goes  left.  If  the  left
subtree  of  node  x  contains  an  interval  that  overlaps  i,  we’re  done,  so

let’s assume that no node in x’s left subtree overlaps i. We need to show
that in this case, no node in x’s right subtree overlaps i, so that going left
will not miss any overlaps in x’s right subtree. By the tests in line 3, the
left subtree of x is not empty and x.left.max ≥ i.low. By the deﬁnition of
the max attribute, x’s left subtree contains some interval i′ such that

i′.high = x.left.max
≥ i.low,

as illustrated in Figure 17.5(b). Since i′ is in x’s left subtree, it does not
overlap  i,  and  since  i′.high  ≥  i.low,  the  interval  trichotomy  tells  us  that
i.high  <  i′.low.  Now  we  bring  in  the  property  that  interval  trees  are
keyed on the low endpoints of intervals. Because i′ is in x’s left subtree,
we  have  i′.low  ≤  x.int.low.  Now  consider  any  interval  i″  in  x’s  right
subtree, so that x.int.low ≤ i″.low. Putting inequalities together, we get

i.high < i′.low

≤ x.int.low
≤ i″.low.

Because i.high < i″.low, the interval trichotomy tells us that i and i″ do
not  overlap.  Since  we  chose  i″  as  any  interval  in  x’s  right  subtree,  no
node in x’s right subtree overlaps i.

Thus, the INTERVAL-SEARCH procedure works correctly.

Exercises

17.3-1
Write  pseudocode  for  LEFT-ROTATE  that  operates  on  nodes  in  an
interval tree and updates all the max attributes that change in O(1) time.

17.3-2
Describe  an  efﬁcient  algorithm  that,  given  an  interval  i,  returns  an
interval overlapping i that has the minimum low endpoint, or T.nil if no
such interval exists.

17.3-3
Given  an  interval  tree  T  and  an  interval  i,  describe  how  to  list  all
intervals  in  T  that  overlap  i  in  O(min  {n,  k  lg  n})  time,  where  k  is  the
number of intervals in the output list. (Hint: One simple method makes
several  queries,  modifying  the  tree  between  queries.  A  slightly  more
complicated method does not modify the tree.)

17.3-4
Suggest modiﬁcations to the interval-tree procedures to support the new
operation  INTERVAL-SEARCH-EXACTLY(T,  i),  where  T  is  an
interval tree and i is an interval. The operation should return a pointer
to  a  node  x  in  T  such  that  x.int.low  =  i.low  and  x.int.high  =  i.high,  or
T.nil if T contains no such node. All operations, including INTERVAL-
SEARCH-EXACTLY, should run in O(lg n) time on an n-node interval
tree.

17.3-5
Show  how  to  maintain  a  dynamic  set  Q  of  numbers  that  supports  the
operation  MIN-GAP,  which  gives  the  absolute  value  of  the  difference
of the two closest numbers in Q. For example, if we have Q = {1, 5, 9,
15, 18, 22}, then MIN-GAP(Q) returns 3, since 15 and 18 are the two
closest  numbers  in  Q.  Make  the  operations  INSERT,  DELETE,
SEARCH,  and  MIN-GAP  as  efﬁcient  as  possible,  and  analyze  their
running times.

★ 17.3-6
VLSI  databases  commonly  represent  an  integrated  circuit  as  a  list  of
rectangles.  Assume  that  each  rectangle  is  rectilinearly  oriented  (sides
parallel  to  the  x-  and  y-axes),  so  that  each  rectangle  is  represented  by
four values: its minimum and maximum x- and y-coordinates. Give an
O(n  lg  n)-time  algorithm  to  decide  whether  a  set  of  n  rectangles  so
represented  contains  two  rectangles  that  overlap.  Your  algorithm  need
not report all intersecting pairs, but it must report that an overlap exists
if  one  rectangle  entirely  covers  another,  even  if  the  boundary  lines  do
not intersect. (Hint: Move a “sweep” line across the set of rectangles.)

Problems

17-1     Point of maximum overlap
You  wish  to  keep  track  of  a  point  of  maximum  overlap  in  a  set  of
intervals—a  point  with  the  largest  number  of  intervals  in  the  set  that
overlap it.

a. Show that there is always a point of maximum overlap that is an

endpoint of one of the intervals.

b. Design a data structure that efﬁciently supports the operations

INTERVAL-INSERT, INTERVAL-DELETE, and FIND-POM,
which returns a point of maximum overlap. (Hint: Keep a red-black
tree of all the endpoints. Associate a value of +1 with each left
endpoint, and associate a value of −1 with each right endpoint.
Augment each node of the tree with some extra information to
maintain the point of maximum overlap.)

17-2     Josephus permutation

We deﬁne the Josephus problem as follows. A group of n people form a
circle,  and  we  are  given  a  positive  integer  m  ≤  n.  Beginning  with  a
designated  ﬁrst  person,  proceed  around  the  circle,  removing  every  mth
person.  After  each  person  is  removed,  counting  continues  around  the
circle that remains. This process continues until nobody remains in the
circle. The order in which the people are removed from the circle deﬁnes
the (n, m)-Josephus permutation of the integers 1, 2, … , n. For example,
the (7, 3)-Josephus permutation is 〈3, 6, 2, 7, 5, 1, 4〉.

a. Suppose that m is a constant. Describe an O(n)-time algorithm that,

given an integer n, outputs the (n, m)-Josephus permutation.

b. Suppose that m is not necessarily a constant. Describe an O(n lg n)-

time algorithm that, given integers n and m, outputs the (n, m)-
Josephus permutation.

Chapter notes

In  their  book,  Preparata  and  Shamos  [364]  describe  several  of  the
interval  trees  that  appear  in  the  literature,  citing  work  by  H.
Edelsbrunner (1980) and E. M. McCreight (1981). The book details an
interval  tree  that,  given  a  static  database  of  n  intervals,  allows  us  to
enumerate all k intervals that overlap a given query interval in O(k + lg
n) time.
