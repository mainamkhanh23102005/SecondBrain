15        Greedy Algorithms

Algorithms for optimization problems typically go through a sequence
of  steps,  with  a  set  of  choices  at  each  step.  For  many  optimization
problems, using dynamic programming to determine the best choices is
overkill,  and  simpler,  more  efﬁcient  algorithms  will  do.  A  greedy
algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That
is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice leads to
a  globally  optimal  solution.  This  chapter  explores  optimization
problems for which greedy algorithms provide optimal solutions. Before
reading  this  chapter,  you  should  read  about  dynamic  programming  in
Chapter 14, particularly Section 14.3.

Greedy  algorithms  do  not  always  yield  optimal  solutions,  but  for
many problems they do. We ﬁrst examine, in Section 15.1, a simple but
nontrivial  problem,  the  activity-selection  problem,  for  which  a  greedy
algorithm  efﬁciently  computes  an  optimal  solution.  We’ll  arrive  at  the
greedy algorithm by ﬁrst considering a dynamic-programming approach
and  then  showing  that  an  optimal  solution  can  result  from  always
making  greedy  choices.  Section  15.2  reviews  the  basic  elements  of  the
greedy  approach,  giving  a  direct  approach  for  proving  greedy
algorithms  correct.  Section  15.3  presents  an  important  application  of
greedy  techniques:  designing  data-compression  (Huffman)  codes.
Finally,  Section  15.4  shows  that  in  order  to  decide  which  blocks  to
replace when a miss occurs in a cache, the “furthest-in-future” strategy
is optimal if the sequence of block accesses is known in advance.

The greedy method is quite powerful and works well for a wide range
of problems. Later chapters will present many algorithms that you can

view  as  applications  of  the  greedy  method,  including  minimum-
spanning-tree algorithms (Chapter 21), Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest
paths  from  a  single  source  (Section  22.3),  and  a  greedy  set-covering
heuristic  (Section  35.3).  Minimum-spanning-tree  algorithms  furnish  a
classic  example  of  the  greedy  method.  Although  you  can  read  this
chapter and Chapter 21 independently of each other, you might ﬁnd it
useful to read them together.

15.1    An activity-selection problem

Our  ﬁrst  example  is  the  problem  of  scheduling  several  competing
activities that require exclusive use of a common resource, with a goal
of  selecting  a  maximum-size  set  of  mutually  compatible  activities.
Imagine  that  you  are  in  charge  of  scheduling  a  conference  room.  You
are  presented  with  a  set  S  =  {a1,  a2,  …  ,  an}  of  n  proposed  activities
that wish to reserve the conference room, and the room can serve only
one  activity  at  a  time.  Each  activity  ai  has  a  start  time  si  and  a  ﬁnish
time fi, where 0 ≤ si < fi < ∞. If selected, activity ai takes place during
the half-open time interval [si, fi). Activities ai and aj are compatible if
the  intervals  [si,  fi)  and  [sj,  fj)  do  not  overlap.  That  is,  ai  and  aj  are
compatible if si ≥ fj or sj ≥ fi. (Assume that if your staff needs time to
change over the room from one activity to the next, the changeover time
is built into the intervals.) In the activity-selection problem, your goal is
to  select  a  maximum-size  subset  of  mutually  compatible  activities.
Assume that the activities are sorted in monotonically increasing order
of ﬁnish time:

(We’ll  see  later  the  advantage  that  this  assumption  provides.)  For
example, consider the set of activities in Figure 15.1. The subset {a3, a9,
a11}  consists  of  mutually  compatible  activities.  It  is  not  a  maximum
subset, however, since the subset {a1, a4, a8, a11} is larger. In fact, {a1,

a4,  a8,  a11}  is  a  largest  subset  of  mutually  compatible  activities,  and
another largest subset is {a2, a4, a9, a11}.

We’ll see how to solve this problem, proceeding in several steps. First
we’ll  explore  a  dynamic-programming  solution,  in  which  you  consider
several  choices  when  determining  which  subproblems  to  use  in  an
optimal solution. We’ll then observe that you need to consider only one
choice—the greedy choice—and that when you make the greedy choice,
only  one  subproblem  remains.  Based  on  these  observations,  we’ll
develop  a  recursive  greedy  algorithm  to  solve  the  activity-selection
problem.  Finally,  we’ll  complete  the  process  of  developing  a  greedy
solution  by  converting  the  recursive  algorithm  to  an  iterative  one.
Although  the  steps  we  go  through  in  this  section  are  slightly  more
involved  than  is  typical  when  developing  a  greedy  algorithm,  they
illustrate  the  relationship  between  greedy  algorithms  and  dynamic
programming.

Figure 15.1 A set {a1, a2, … , a11} of activities. Activity ai has start time si and ﬁnish time fi.

The optimal substructure of the activity-selection problem

Let’s  verify  that  the  activity-selection  problem  exhibits  optimal
substructure. Denote by Sij the set of activities that start after activity ai
ﬁnishes and that ﬁnish before activity aj starts. Suppose that you want
to  ﬁnd  a  maximum  set  of  mutually  compatible  activities  in  Sij,  and
suppose  further  that  such  a  maximum  set  is  Aij,  which  includes  some
activity ak. By including ak in an optimal solution, you are left with two
subproblems:  ﬁnding  mutually  compatible  activities  in  the  set  Sik
(activities  that  start  after  activity  ai  ﬁnishes  and  that  ﬁnish  before
activity  ak  starts)  and  ﬁnding  mutually  compatible  activities  in  the  set
Skj  (activities  that  start  after  activity  ak  ﬁnishes  and  that  ﬁnish  before

activity aj starts). Let Aik = Aij ∩ Sik and Akj = Aij ∩ Skj, so that Aik
contains the activities in Aij that ﬁnish before ak starts and Akj contains
the activities in Aij that start after ak ﬁnishes. Thus, we have Aij = Aik ∪
{ak}  ∪  Akj,  and  so  the  maximum-size  set  Aij  of  mutually  compatible
activities in Sij consists of |Aij | = |Aik| + |Akj | + 1 activities.

The  usual  cut-and-paste  argument  shows  that  an  optimal  solution
Aij must also include optimal solutions to the two subproblems for Sik
 of mutually compatible activities in
and Skj. If you could ﬁnd a set
Skj  where
,  rather  than  Akj,  in  a
solution to the subproblem for Sij. You would have constructed a set of
  mutually  compatible  activities,
which  contradicts  the  assumption  that  Aij  is  an  optimal  solution.  A
symmetric argument applies to the activities in Sik.

,  then  you  could  use

This  way  of  characterizing  optimal  substructure  suggests  that  you
can solve the activity-selection problem by dynamic programming. Let’s
denote the size of an optimal solution for the set Sij by c[i, j]. Then, the
dynamic-programming approach gives the recurrence

c[i, j] = c[i, k] + c[k, j] + 1.

Of course, if you do not know that an optimal solution for the set Sij
includes activity ak, you must examine all activities in Sij to ﬁnd which
one to choose, so that

You can then develop a recursive algorithm and memoize it, or you can
work bottom-up and ﬁll in table entries as you go along. But you would
be overlooking another important characteristic of the activity-selection
problem that you can use to great advantage.

Making the greedy choice

What  if  you  could  choose  an  activity  to  add  to  an  optimal  solution
without  having  to  ﬁrst  solve  all  the  subproblems?  That  could  save  you
from having to consider all the choices inherent in recurrence (15.2). In
fact,  for  the  activity-selection  problem,  you  need  to  consider  only  one
choice: the greedy choice.

What  is  the  greedy  choice  for  the  activity-selection  problem?
Intuition  suggests  that  you  should  choose  an  activity  that  leaves  the
resource  available  for  as  many  other  activities  as  possible.  Of  the
activities  you  end  up  choosing,  one  of  them  must  be  the  ﬁrst  one  to
ﬁnish. Intuition says, therefore, choose the activity in S with the earliest
ﬁnish  time,  since  that  leaves  the  resource  available  for  as  many  of  the
activities  that  follow  it  as  possible.  (If  more  than  one  activity  in  S  has
the  earliest  ﬁnish  time,  then  choose  any  such  activity.)  In  other  words,
since the activities are sorted in monotonically increasing order by ﬁnish
time, the greedy choice is activity a1. Choosing the ﬁrst activity to ﬁnish
is not the only way to think of making a greedy choice for this problem.
Exercise 15.1-3 asks you to explore other possibilities.

Once  you  make  the  greedy  choice,  you  have  only  one  remaining
subproblem  to  solve:  ﬁnding  activities  that  start  after  a1  ﬁnishes.  Why
don’t you have to consider activities that ﬁnish before a1 starts? Because
s1  <  f1,  and  because  f1  is  the  earliest  ﬁnish  time  of  any  activity,  no
activity  can  have  a  ﬁnish  time  less  than  or  equal  to  s1.  Thus,  all
activities that are compatible with activity a1 must start after a1 ﬁnishes.
Furthermore,  we  have  already  established  that  the  activity-selection
problem exhibits optimal substructure. Let Sk = {ai ∈ S : si ≥ fk} be the
set  of  activities  that  start  after  activity  ak  ﬁnishes.  If  you  make  the
greedy choice of activity a1, then S1 remains as the only subproblem to
solve.1  Optimal  substructure  says  that  if  a1  belongs  to  an  optimal
solution,  then  an  optimal  solution  to  the  original  problem  consists  of
activity  a1  and  all  the  activities  in  an  optimal  solution  to  the
subproblem S1.

One  big  question  remains:  Is  this  intuition  correct?  Is  the  greedy
choice—in which you choose the ﬁrst activity to ﬁnish—always part of

some optimal solution? The following theorem shows that it is.

Theorem 15.1
Consider any nonempty subproblem Sk, and let am be an activity in Sk
with the earliest ﬁnish time. Then am is included in some maximum-size
subset of mutually compatible activities of Sk.

Proof      Let  Ak  be  a  maximum-size  subset  of  mutually  compatible
activities  in  Sk,  and  let  aj  be  the  activity  in  Ak  with  the  earliest  ﬁnish
time. If aj = am, we are done, since we have shown that am belongs to
some  maximum-size  subset  of  mutually  compatible  activities  of  Sk.  If
aj ≠ am, let the set
 be Ak but substituting am for
  are  compatible,  which  follows  because  the
aj.  The  activities  in
activities in Ak are compatible, aj is the ﬁrst activity in Ak to ﬁnish, and
 is a maximum-size subset
fm ≤ fj. Since
of mutually compatible activities of Sk, and it includes am.

, we conclude that

▪

Although  you  might  be  able  to  solve  the  activity-selection  problem
with dynamic programming, Theorem 15.1 says that you don’t need to.
Instead,  you  can  repeatedly  choose  the  activity  that  ﬁnishes  ﬁrst,  keep
only  the  activities  compatible  with  this  activity,  and  repeat  until  no
activities remain. Moreover, because you always choose the activity with
the earliest ﬁnish time, the ﬁnish times of the activities that you choose
must strictly increase. You can consider each activity just once overall,
in monotonically increasing order of ﬁnish times.

like  a

An  algorithm  to  solve  the  activity-selection  problem  does  not  need
to  work  bottom-up,
table-based  dynamic-programming
algorithm.  Instead,  it  can  work  top-down,  choosing  an  activity  to  put
into  the  optimal  solution  that  it  constructs  and  then  solving  the
subproblem of choosing activities from those that are compatible with
those  already  chosen.  Greedy  algorithms  typically  have  this  top-down
design:  make  a  choice  and  then  solve  a  subproblem,  rather  than  the
bottom-up technique of solving subproblems before making a choice.

A recursive greedy algorithm

Now  that  you  know  you  can  bypass  the  dynamic-programming
approach  and  instead  use  a  top-down,  greedy  algorithm,  let’s  see  a
straightforward,  recursive  procedure  to  solve  the  activity-selection
problem.  The  procedure  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR  on
the  following  page  takes  the  start  and  ﬁnish  times  of  the  activities,
represented as arrays s and f,2 the index k that deﬁnes the subproblem
Sk  it  is  to  solve,  and  the  size  n  of  the  original  problem.  It  returns  a
maximum-size  set  of  mutually  compatible  activities  in  Sk.  The
procedure  assumes  that  the  n  input  activities  are  already  ordered  by
monotonically  increasing  ﬁnish  time,  according  to  equation  (15.1).  If
not,  you  can  ﬁrst  sort  them  into  this  order  in  O(n  lg  n)  time,  breaking
ties arbitrarily. In order to start, add the ﬁctitious activity a0 with f0 =
0, so that subproblem S0 is the entire set of activities S. The initial call,
which  solves
is  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-
SELECTOR (s, f, 0, n).

the  entire  problem,

RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR (s, f, k, n)

// ﬁnd the ﬁrst activity in Sk to ﬁnish

m = m + 1

4 if m ≤ n
5

return  {am}  ∪  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR  (s,  f,  m,

n)

6 else return ∅

Figure  15.2  shows  how  the  algorithm  operates  on  the  activities  in
Figure  15.1.  In  a  given  recursive  call  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-
SELECTOR  (s,  f,  k,  n),  the  while  loop  of  lines  2–3  looks  for  the  ﬁrst
activity in Sk to ﬁnish. The loop examines ak+1, ak+2, … , an, until it
ﬁnds the ﬁrst activity am that is compatible with ak, which means that
sm  ≥  fk.  If  the  loop  terminates  because  it  ﬁnds  such  an  activity,  line  5

returns the union of {am} and the maximum-size subset of Sm returned
by the recursive call RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR (s, f, m, n).
Alternatively, the loop may terminate because m > n, in which case the
procedure  has  examined  all  activities  in  Sk  without  ﬁnding  one  that  is
compatible with ak. In this case, Sk = ∅, and so line 6 returns ∅.

Assuming that the activities have already been sorted by ﬁnish times,
the running time of the call RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR (s,
f,  0,  n)  is  Θ(n).  To  see  why,  observe  that  over  all  recursive  calls,  each
activity  is  examined  exactly  once  in  the  while  loop  test  of  line  2.  In
particular, activity ai is examined in the last call made in which k < i.

An iterative greedy algorithm

The recursive procedure can be converted to an iterative one because the
is  almost  “tail
procedure  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR
recursive”  (see  Problem  7-5):  it  ends  with  a  recursive  call  to  itself
followed  by  a  union  operation.  It  is  usually  a  straightforward  task  to
transform a tail-recursive procedure to an iterative form. In fact, some
compilers  for  certain  programming
languages  perform  this  task
automatically.

Figure 15.2 The operation of RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR on the 11 activities from
Figure  15.1.  Activities  considered  in  each  recursive  call  appear  between  horizontal  lines.  The
ﬁctitious  activity  a0  ﬁnishes  at  time  0,  and  the  initial  call  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-
SELECTOR (s, f, 0, 11), selects activity a1. In each recursive call, the activities that have already
been selected are blue, and the activity shown in tan is being considered. If the starting time of
an activity occurs before the ﬁnish time of the most recently added activity (the arrow between
them  points  left),  it  is  rejected.  Otherwise  (the  arrow  points  directly  up  or  to  the  right),  it  is
selected.  The  last  recursive  call,  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR  (s,  f,  11,  11),  returns
∅. The resulting set of selected activities is {a1, a4, a8, a11}.

The  procedure  GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR  is  an  iterative
version  of  the  procedure  RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR.  It,
too,  assumes  that  the  input  activities  are  ordered  by  monotonically
increasing  ﬁnish  time.  It  collects  selected  activities  into  a  set  A  and
returns this set when it is done.

GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR (s, f, n)

A = A ∪ {am}
k = m

5

7 return A

// is am in Sk?
// yes, so choose it
// and continue from there

The  procedure  works  as  follows.  The  variable  k  indexes  the  most
recent  addition  to  A,  corresponding  to  the  activity  ak  in  the  recursive
version.  Since  the  procedure  considers  the  activities  in  order  of
monotonically  increasing  ﬁnish  time,  fk  is  always  the  maximum  ﬁnish
time of any activity in A. That is,

Lines 1–2 select activity a1, initialize A to contain just this activity, and
initialize  k  to  index  this  activity.  The  for  loop  of  lines  3–6  ﬁnds  the
earliest  activity  in  Sk  to  ﬁnish.  The  loop  considers  each  activity  am  in
turn  and  adds  am  to  A  if  it  is  compatible  with  all  previously  selected
activities. Such an activity is the earliest in Sk to ﬁnish. To see whether
activity am is compatible with every activity currently in A, it sufﬁces by
equation  (15.3)  to  check  (in  line  4)  that  its  start  time  sm  is  not  earlier
than  the  ﬁnish  time  fk  of  the  activity  most  recently  added  to  A.  If
activity am is compatible, then lines 5–6 add activity am to A and set k
to  m.  The  set  A  returned  by  the  call  GREEDY-ACTIVITY-

SELECTOR  (s,  f)  is  precisely  the  set  returned  by  the  initial  call
RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR (s, f, 0, n).

Like  the  recursive  version,  GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR
schedules a set of n activities in Θ(n) time, assuming that the activities
were already sorted initially by their ﬁnish times.

Exercises

15.1-1
Give  a  dynamic-programming  algorithm  for  the  activity-selection
problem, based on recurrence (15.2). Have your algorithm compute the
sizes c[i, j] as deﬁned above and also produce the maximum-size subset
of  mutually  compatible  activities.  Assume  that  the  inputs  have  been
sorted as in equation (15.1). Compare the running time of your solution
to the running time of GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR.

15.1-2
Suppose that instead of always selecting the ﬁrst activity to ﬁnish, you
instead  select  the  last  activity  to  start  that  is  compatible  with  all
previously  selected  activities.  Describe  how  this  approach  is  a  greedy
algorithm, and prove that it yields an optimal solution.

15.1-3
Not just any greedy approach to the activity-selection problem produces
a maximum-size set of mutually compatible activities. Give an example
to  show  that  the  approach  of  selecting  the  activity  of  least  duration
from among those that are compatible with previously selected activities
does not work. Do the same for the approaches of always selecting the
compatible  activity  that  overlaps  the  fewest  other  remaining  activities
and always selecting the compatible remaining activity with the earliest
start time.

15.1-4
You  are  given  a  set  of  activities  to  schedule  among  a  large  number  of
lecture halls, where any activity can take place in any lecture hall. You
wish to schedule all the activities using as few lecture halls as possible.

Give  an  efﬁcient  greedy  algorithm  to  determine  which  activity  should
use which lecture hall.

(This  problem  is  also  known  as  the  interval-graph  coloring  problem.
It is modeled by an interval graph whose vertices are the given activities
and  whose  edges  connect  incompatible  activities.  The  smallest  number
of colors required to color every vertex so that no two adjacent vertices
have  the  same  color  corresponds  to  ﬁnding  the  fewest  lecture  halls
needed to schedule all of the given activities.)

15.1-5
Consider a modiﬁcation to the activity-selection problem in which each
activity  ai  has,  in  addition  to  a  start  and  ﬁnish  time,  a  value  vi.  The
objective  is  no  longer  to  maximize  the  number  of  activities  scheduled,
but instead to maximize the total value of the activities scheduled. That
is,  the  goal  is  to  choose  a  set  A  of  compatible  activities  such  that
  is  maximized.  Give  a  polynomial-time  algorithm  for  this

problem.

15.2    Elements of the greedy strategy

A  greedy  algorithm  obtains  an  optimal  solution  to  a  problem  by
making  a  sequence  of  choices.  At  each  decision  point,  the  algorithm
makes the choice that seems best at the moment. This heuristic strategy
does  not  always  produce  an  optimal  solution,  but  as  in  the  activity-
selection problem, sometimes it does. This section discusses some of the
general properties of greedy methods.

The  process  that  we  followed  in  Section  15.1  to  develop  a  greedy
algorithm  was  a  bit  more  involved  than  is  typical.  It  consisted  of  the
following steps:

1. Determine the optimal substructure of the problem.

2. Develop a recursive solution. (For the activity-selection problem,
we  formulated  recurrence  (15.2),  but  bypassed  developing  a
recursive algorithm based solely on this recurrence.)

3. Show  that  if  you  make  the  greedy  choice,  then  only  one

subproblem remains.

4. Prove  that  it  is  always  safe  to  make  the  greedy  choice.  (Steps  3

and 4 can occur in either order.)

5. Develop  a  recursive  algorithm  that  implements  the  greedy

strategy.

6. Convert the recursive algorithm to an iterative algorithm.

These  steps  highlighted  in  great  detail  the  dynamic-programming
underpinnings  of  a  greedy  algorithm.  For  example,  the  ﬁrst  cut  at  the
activity-selection problem deﬁned the subproblems Sij, where both i and
j varied. We then found that if you always make the greedy choice, you
can restrict the subproblems to be of the form Sk.

An  alternative  approach  is  to  fashion  optimal  substructure  with  a
greedy choice in mind, so that the choice leaves just one subproblem to
solve.  In  the  activity-selection  problem,  start  by  dropping  the  second
subscript and deﬁning subproblems of the form Sk. Then prove that a
greedy  choice  (the  ﬁrst  activity  am  to  ﬁnish  in  Sk),  combined  with  an
optimal solution to the remaining set Sm of compatible activities, yields
an  optimal  solution  to  Sk.  More  generally,  you  can  design  greedy
algorithms according to the following sequence of steps:

1. Cast  the  optimization  problem  as  one  in  which  you  make  a

choice and are left with one subproblem to solve.

2. Prove  that  there  is  always  an  optimal  solution  to  the  original
problem that makes the greedy choice, so that the greedy choice
is always safe.

3. Demonstrate optimal substructure by showing that, having made
the  greedy  choice,  what  remains  is  a  subproblem  with  the
property  that  if  you  combine  an  optimal  solution  to  the
subproblem with the greedy choice you have made, you arrive at
an optimal solution to the original problem.

Later  sections  of  this  chapter  will  use  this  more  direct  process.
Nevertheless,  beneath  every  greedy  algorithm,  there  is  almost  always  a
more cumbersome dynamic-programming solution.

How can you tell whether a greedy algorithm will solve a particular
optimization problem? No way works all the time, but the greedy-choice
property  and  optimal  substructure  are  the  two  key  ingredients.  If  you
can demonstrate that the problem has these properties, then you are well
on the way to developing a greedy algorithm for it.

Greedy-choice property

The ﬁrst key ingredient is the greedy-choice property: you can assemble
a globally optimal solution by making locally optimal (greedy) choices.
In  other  words,  when  you  are  considering  which  choice  to  make,  you
make  the  choice  that  looks  best  in  the  current  problem,  without
considering results from subproblems.

Here is where greedy algorithms differ from dynamic programming.
In  dynamic  programming,  you  make  a  choice  at  each  step,  but  the
choice usually depends on the solutions to subproblems. Consequently,
you  typically  solve  dynamic-programming  problems  in  a  bottom-up
manner,  progressing  from  smaller  subproblems  to  larger  subproblems.
(Alternatively, you can solve them top down, but memoizing. Of course,
even  though  the  code  works  top  down,  you  still  must  solve  the
subproblems before making a choice.) In a greedy algorithm, you make
whatever  choice  seems  best  at  the  moment  and  then  solve  the
subproblem that remains. The choice made by a greedy algorithm may
depend on choices so far, but it cannot depend on any future choices or
on  the  solutions  to  subproblems.  Thus,  unlike  dynamic  programming,
which  solves  the  subproblems  before  making  the  ﬁrst  choice,  a  greedy
algorithm  makes  its  ﬁrst  choice  before  solving  any  subproblems.  A
dynamic-programming algorithm proceeds bottom up, whereas a greedy
strategy  usually  progresses  top  down,  making  one  greedy  choice  after
another, reducing each given problem instance to a smaller one.

Of course, you need to prove that a greedy choice at each step yields
a  globally  optimal  solution.  Typically,  as  in  the  case  of  Theorem  15.1,
the proof examines a globally optimal solution to some subproblem. It

then shows how to modify the solution to substitute the greedy choice
for some other choice, resulting in one similar, but smaller, subproblem.
You can usually make the greedy choice more efﬁciently than when
you have to consider a wider set of choices. For example, in the activity-
selection  problem,  assuming  that  the  activities  were  already  sorted  in
monotonically increasing order by ﬁnish times, each activity needed to
be  examined  just  once.  By  preprocessing  the  input  or  by  using  an
appropriate data structure (often a priority queue), you often can make
greedy choices quickly, thus yielding an efﬁcient algorithm.

Optimal substructure

As we saw in Chapter 14, a problem exhibits optimal substructure if an
optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to
subproblems.  This  property  is  a  key  ingredient  of  assessing  whether
dynamic  programming  applies,  and  it’s  also  essential  for  greedy
algorithms. As an example of optimal substructure, recall how Section
15.1  demonstrated  that  if  an  optimal  solution  to  subproblem  Sij
includes  an  activity  ak,  then  it  must  also  contain  optimal  solutions  to
the  subproblems  Sik  and  Skj.  Given  this  optimal  substructure,  we
argued that if you know which activity to use as ak, you can construct
an  optimal  solution  to  Sij  by  selecting  ak  along  with  all  activities  in
optimal solutions to the subproblems Sik and Skj. This observation of
optimal substructure gave rise to the recurrence (15.2) that describes the
value of an optimal solution.

You  will  usually  use  a  more  direct  approach  regarding  optimal
substructure  when  applying  it  to  greedy  algorithms.  As  mentioned
above,  you  have  the  luxury  of  assuming  that  you  arrived  at  a
subproblem by having made the greedy choice in the original problem.
All  you  really  need  to  do  is  argue  that  an  optimal  solution  to  the
subproblem,  combined  with  the  greedy  choice  already  made,  yields  an
optimal  solution  to  the  original  problem.  This  scheme  implicitly  uses
induction on the subproblems to prove that making the greedy choice at
every step produces an optimal solution.

Greedy versus dynamic programming

Because  both  the  greedy  and  dynamic-programming  strategies  exploit
optimal  substructure,  you  might  be  tempted  to  generate  a  dynamic-
programming solution to a problem when a greedy solution sufﬁces or,
conversely,  you  might  mistakenly  think  that  a  greedy  solution  works
when in fact a dynamic-programming solution is required. To illustrate
the  subtle  differences  between  the  two  techniques,  let’s  investigate  two
variants of a classical optimization problem.

The  0-1  knapsack  problem  is  the  following.  A  thief  robbing  a  store
wants to take the most valuable load that can be carried in a knapsack
capable of carrying at most W pounds of loot. The thief can choose to
take any subset of n items in the store. The ith item is worth vi dollars
and weighs wi pounds, where vi and wi are integers. Which items should
the thief take? (We call this the 0-1 knapsack problem because for each
item,  the  thief  must  either  take  it  or  leave  it  behind.  The  thief  cannot
take a fractional amount of an item or take an item more than once.)

In  the  fractional  knapsack  problem,  the  setup  is  the  same,  but  the
thief  can  take  fractions  of  items,  rather  than  having  to  make  a  binary
(0-1) choice for each item. You can think of an item in the 0-1 knapsack
problem  as  being  like  a  gold  ingot  and  an  item  in  the  fractional
knapsack problem as more like gold dust.

Both  knapsack  problems  exhibit  the  optimal-substructure  property.
For  the  0-1  problem,  if  the  most  valuable  load  weighing  at  most  W
pounds  includes  item  j,  then  the  remaining  load  must  be  the  most
valuable load weighing at most W − wj pounds that the thief can take
from  the  n  −  1  original  items  excluding  item  j.  For  the  comparable
fractional  problem,  if  if  the  most  valuable  load  weighing  at  most  W
pounds includes weight w of item j, then the remaining load must be the
most valuable load weighing at most W − w pounds that the thief can
take from the n − 1 original items plus wj − w pounds of item j.

Although the problems are similar, a greedy strategy works to solve
the fractional knapsack problem, but not the 0-1 problem. To solve the
fractional  problem,  ﬁrst  compute  the  value  per  pound  vi/wi  for  each
item. Obeying a greedy strategy, the thief begins by taking as much as

possible of the item with the greatest value per pound. If the supply of
that item is exhausted and the thief can still carry more, then the thief
takes  as  much  as  possible  of  the  item  with  the  next  greatest  value  per
pound, and so forth, until reaching the weight limit W. Thus, by sorting
the  items  by  value  per  pound,  the  greedy  algorithm  runs  in  O(n  lg  n)
time. You are asked to prove that the fractional knapsack problem has
the greedy-choice property in Exercise 15.2-1.

To see that this greedy strategy does not work for the 0-1 knapsack
problem,  consider  the  problem  instance  illustrated  in  Figure  15.3(a).
This example has three items and a knapsack that can hold 50 pounds.
Item  1  weighs  10  pounds  and  is  worth  $60.  Item  2  weighs  20  pounds
and  is  worth  $100.  Item  3  weighs  30  pounds  and  is  worth  $120.  Thus,
the value per pound of item 1 is $6 per pound, which is greater than the
value  per  pound  of  either  item  2  ($5  per  pound)  or  item  3  ($4  per
pound). The greedy strategy, therefore, would take item 1 ﬁrst. As you
can  see  from  the  case  analysis  in  Figure  15.3(b),  however,  the  optimal
solution  takes  items  2  and  3,  leaving  item  1  behind.  The  two  possible
solutions that take item 1 are both suboptimal.

For the comparable fractional problem, however, the greedy strategy,
which  takes  item  1  ﬁrst,  does  yield  an  optimal  solution,  as  shown  in
Figure 15.3(c). Taking item 1 doesn’t work in the 0-1 problem, because
the thief is unable to ﬁll the knapsack to capacity, and the empty space
lowers  the  effective  value  per  pound  of  the  load.  In  the  0-1  problem,
when  you  consider  whether  to  include  an  item  in  the  knapsack,  you
must  compare  the  solution  to  the  subproblem  that  includes  the  item
with  the  solution  to  the  subproblem  that  excludes  the  item  before  you
can  make  the  choice.  The  problem  formulated  in  this  way  gives  rise  to
many overlapping subproblems—a hallmark of dynamic programming,
and indeed, as Exercise 15.2-2 asks you to show, you can use dynamic
programming to solve the 0-1 problem.

Figure  15.3  An  example  showing  that  the  greedy  strategy  does  not  work  for  the  0-1  knapsack
problem.  (a)  The  thief  must  select  a  subset  of  the  three  items  shown  whose  weight  must  not
exceed  50  pounds.  (b)  The  optimal  subset  includes  items  2  and  3.  Any  solution  with  item  1  is
suboptimal,  even  though  item  1  has  the  greatest  value  per  pound.  (c)  For  the  fractional
knapsack  problem,  taking  the  items  in  order  of  greatest  value  per  pound  yields  an  optimal
solution.

Dakota. The professor plans to cross the state on highway U.S. 2, which

runs  from  Grand  Forks,  on  the  eastern  border  with  Minnesota,  to
Williston,  near  the  western  border  with  Montana.  The  professor  can
carry  two  liters  of  water  and  can  skate  m  miles  before  running  out  of
water.  (Because  North  Dakota  is  relatively  ﬂat,  the  professor  does  not
have to worry about drinking water at a greater rate on uphill sections
than  on  ﬂat  or  downhill  sections.)  The  professor  will  start  in  Grand
Forks with two full liters of water. The professor has an ofﬁcial North
Dakota state map, which shows all the places along U.S. 2 to reﬁll water
and the distances between these locations.

15.3    Huffman codes

Huffman codes compress data well: savings of 20% to 90% are typical,
depending  on  the  characteristics  of  the  data  being  compressed.  The

data  arrive  as  a  sequence  of  characters.  Huffman’s  greedy  algorithm
uses  a  table  giving  how  often  each  character  occurs  (its  frequency)  to
build  up  an  optimal  way  of  representing  each  character  as  a  binary
string.

Suppose that you have a 100,000-character data ﬁle that you wish to
store compactly and you know that the 6 distinct characters in the ﬁle
occur with the frequencies given by Figure 15.4. The character a occurs
45,000 times, the character b occurs 13,000 times, and so on.

You  have  many  options  for  how  to  represent  such  a  ﬁle  of
information.  Here,  we  consider  the  problem  of  designing  a  binary
character code (or code for short) in which each character is represented
by a unique binary string, which we call a codeword. If you use a ﬁxed-
length  code,  you  need  ⌈lg  n⌉  bits  to  represent  n  ≥  2  characters.  For  6
characters,  therefore,  you  need  3  bits:  a  =  000,  b  =  001,  c  =  010,  d  =
011, e = 100, and f = 101. This method requires 300,000 bits to encode
the entire ﬁle. Can you do better?

Figure  15.4  A  character-coding  problem.  A  data  ﬁle  of  100,000  characters  contains  only  the
characters  a–f,  with  the  frequencies  indicated.  With  each  character  represented  by  a  3-bit
codeword,  encoding  the  ﬁle  requires  300,000  bits.  With  the  variable-length  code  shown,  the
encoding requires only 224,000 bits.

A variable-length code can do considerably better than a ﬁxed-length
code. The idea is simple: give frequent characters short codewords and
infrequent  characters  long  codewords.  Figure  15.4  shows  such  a  code.
Here, the 1-bit string 0 represents a, and the 4-bit string 1100 represents
f. This code requires
(45 · 1 + 13 · 3 + 12 · 3 + 16 · 3 + 9 · 4 + 5 · 4) · 1,000 = 224,000 bits

to represent the ﬁle, a savings of approximately 25%. In fact, this is an
optimal character code for this ﬁle, as we shall see.

Preﬁx-free codes

We  consider  here  only  codes  in  which  no  codeword  is  also  a  preﬁx  of
some other codeword. Such codes are called preﬁx-free codes. Although
we won’t prove it here, a preﬁx-free code can always achieve the optimal
data compression among any character code, and so we suffer no loss of
generality by restricting our attention to preﬁx-free codes.

Encoding  is  always  simple  for  any  binary  character  code:  just
concatenate  the  codewords  representing  each  character  of  the  ﬁle.  For
example, with the variable-length preﬁx-free code of Figure 15.4, the 4-
character  ﬁle  face  has  the  encoding  1100  ·  0  ·  100  ·  1101  =
110001001101, where “·” denotes concatenation.

Preﬁx-free codes are desirable because they simplify decoding. Since
no  codeword  is  a  preﬁx  of  any  other,  the  codeword  that  begins  an
encoded  ﬁle  is  unambiguous.  You  can  simply  identify  the  initial
codeword,  translate  it  back  to  the  original  character,  and  repeat  the
decoding process on the remainder of the encoded ﬁle. In our example,
the string 100011001101 parses uniquely as 100 · 0 · 1100 · 1101, which
decodes to cafe.

Figure 15.5 Trees corresponding to the coding schemes in Figure 15.4. Each leaf is labeled with
a character and its frequency of occurrence. Each internal node is labeled with the sum of the
frequencies  of  the  leaves  in  its  subtree.  All  frequencies  are  in  thousands.  (a)  The  tree
corresponding to the ﬁxed-length code a = 000, b = 001, c = 010, d = 011, e = 100, f = 101. (b)
The tree corresponding to the optimal preﬁx-free code a = 0, b = 101, c = 100, d = 111, e =
1101, f = 1100.

The  decoding  process  needs  a  convenient  representation  for  the
preﬁx-free code so that you can easily pick off the initial codeword. A

binary  tree  whose  leaves  are  the  given  characters  provides  one  such
representation.  Interpret  the  binary  codeword  for  a  character  as  the
simple path from the root to that character, where 0 means “go to the
left  child”  and  1  means  “go  to  the  right  child.”  Figure  15.5  shows  the
trees for the two codes of our example. Note that these are not binary
search  trees,  since  the  leaves  need  not  appear  in  sorted  order  and
internal nodes do not contain character keys.

An optimal code for a ﬁle is always represented by a full binary tree,
in which every nonleaf node has two children (see Exercise 15.3-2). The
ﬁxed-length code in our example is not optimal since its tree, shown in
Figure 15.5(a), is not a full binary tree: it contains codewords beginning
with  10,  but  none  beginning  with  11.  Since  we  can  now  restrict  our
attention to full binary trees, we can say that if C is the alphabet from
which  the  characters  are  drawn  and  all  character  frequencies  are
positive,  then  the  tree  for  an  optimal  preﬁx-free  code  has  exactly  |C  |
leaves, one for each letter of the alphabet, and exactly |C | − 1 internal
nodes (see Exercise B.5-3 on page 1175).

Given a tree T corresponding to a preﬁx-free code, we can compute
the number of bits required to encode a ﬁle. For each character c in the
alphabet C, let the attribute c.freq denote the frequency of c in the ﬁle
and let dT(c) denote the depth of c’s leaf in the tree. Note that dT (c) is
also  the  length  of  the  codeword  for  character  c.  The  number  of  bits
required to encode a ﬁle is thus

which we deﬁne as the cost of the tree T.

Constructing a Huffman code

Huffman invented a greedy algorithm that constructs an optimal preﬁx-
free  code,  called  a  Huffman  code  in  his  honor.  In  line  with  our
observations  in  Section  15.2,  its  proof  of  correctness  relies  on  the
greedy-choice  property  and  optimal  substructure.  Rather
than
demonstrating  that  these  properties  hold  and  then  developing

pseudocode, we present the pseudocode ﬁrst. Doing so will help clarify
how the algorithm makes greedy choices.

The procedure HUFFMAN assumes that C is a set of n characters
and that each character c ∈ C is an object with an attribute c.freq giving
its  frequency.  The  algorithm  builds  the  tree  T  corresponding  to  an
optimal code in a bottom-up manner. It begins with a set of |C | leaves
and performs a sequence of |C | − 1 “merging” operations to create the
ﬁnal tree. The algorithm uses a min-priority queue Q, keyed on the freq
attribute,  to  identify  the  two  least-frequent  objects  to  merge  together.
The result of merging two objects is a new object whose frequency is the
sum of the frequencies of the two objects that were merged.

For our example, Huffman’s algorithm proceeds as shown in Figure
15.6. Since the alphabet contains 6 letters, the initial queue size is n = 6,
and  5  merge  steps  build  the  tree.  The  ﬁnal  tree  represents  the  optimal
preﬁx-free code. The codeword for a letter is the sequence of edge labels
on the simple path from the root to the letter.

Figure 15.6 The steps of Huffman’s algorithm for the frequencies given in Figure 15.4. Each part
shows the contents of the queue sorted into increasing order by frequency. Each step merges the
two trees with the lowest frequencies. Leaves are shown as rectangles containing a character and
its frequency. Internal nodes are shown as circles containing the sum of the frequencies of their
children. An edge connecting an internal node with its children is labeled 0 if it is an edge to a
left child and 1 if it is an edge to a right child. The codeword for a letter is the sequence of labels
on the edges connecting the root to the leaf for that letter. (a) The initial set of n = 6 nodes, one
for each letter. (b)–(e) Intermediate stages. (f) The ﬁnal tree.

The  HUFFMAN  procedure  works  as  follows.  Line  2  initializes  the
min-priority queue Q with the characters in C. The for loop in lines 3–
10 repeatedly extracts the two nodes x and y of lowest frequency from
the  queue  and  replaces  them  in  the  queue  with  a  new  node  z
representing their merger. The frequency of z is computed as the sum of
the frequencies of x and y in line 9. The node z has x as its left child and
y as its right child. (This order is arbitrary. Switching the left and right
child of any node yields a different code of the same cost.) After n − 1

mergers, line 11 returns the one node left in the queue, which is the root
of the code tree.

The algorithm produces the same result without the variables x and
y, assigning the values returned by the EXTRACT-MIN calls directly to
z.left  and  z.right  in  lines  7  and  8,  and  changing  line  9  to  z.freq  =
z.left.freq+z.right.freq. We’ll use the node names x and y in the proof of
correctness, however, so we leave them in.

The running time of Huffman’s algorithm depends on how the min-
priority queue Q is implemented. Let’s assume that it’s implemented as
a  binary  min-heap  (see  Chapter  6).  For  a  set  C  of  n  characters,  the
BUILD-MIN-HEAP procedure discussed in Section 6.3 can initialize Q
in line 2 in O(n) time. The for loop in lines 3–10 executes exactly n − 1
times,  and  since  each  heap  operation  runs  in  O(lg  n)  time,  the  loop
contributes O(n lg n) to the running time. Thus, the total running time
of HUFFMAN on a set of n characters is O(n lg n).

Correctness of Huffman’s algorithm

To  prove  that  the  greedy  algorithm  HUFFMAN  is  correct,  we’ll  show
that the problem of determining an optimal preﬁx-free code exhibits the
greedy-choice  and  optimal-substructure  properties.  The  next  lemma
shows that the greedy-choice property holds.

Lemma 15.2 (Optimal preﬁx-free codes have the greedy-choice property)
Let  C  be  an  alphabet  in  which  each  character  c  ∈  C  has  frequency
c.freq. Let x and y be two characters in C having the lowest frequencies.
Then  there  exists  an  optimal  preﬁx-free  code  for  C  in  which  the
codewords for x and y have the same length and differ only in the last
bit.

Proof      The  idea  of  the  proof  is  to  take  the  tree  T  representing  an
arbitrary  optimal  preﬁx-free  code  and  modify  it  to  make  a  tree
representing another optimal preﬁx-free code such that the characters x
and  y  appear  as  sibling  leaves  of  maximum  depth  in  the  new  tree.  In
such a tree, the codewords for x and y have the same length and differ
only in the last bit.

Let a and b be any two characters that are sibling leaves of maximum
depth in T. Without loss of generality, assume that a.freq ≤ b.freq and
x.freq  ≤  y.freq.  Since  x.freq  and  y.freq  are  the  two  lowest  leaf
frequencies, in order, and a.freq and b.freq are two arbitrary frequencies,
in order, we have x.freq ≤ a.freq and y.freq ≤ b.freq.

In the remainder of the proof, it is possible that we could have x.freq
= a.freq or y.freq = b.freq, but x.freq = b.freq implies that a.freq = b.freq
= x.freq = y.freq (see Exercise 15.3-1), and the lemma would be trivially
true. Therefore, assume that x.freq ≠ b.freq, which means that x ≠ b.

Figure 15.7 An illustration of the key step in the proof of Lemma 15.2. In the optimal tree T,
leaves a and b are two siblings of maximum depth. Leaves x and y are the two characters with
the lowest frequencies. They appear in arbitrary positions in T. Assuming that x ≠ b, swapping
leaves a and x produces tree T′, and then swapping leaves b and y produces tree T ″. Since each
swap does not increase the cost, the resulting tree T ″ is also an optimal tree.

As  Figure  15.7  shows,  imagine  exchanging  the  positions  in  T  of  a
and x to produce a tree T′, and then exchanging the positions in T′ of b
and  y  to  produce  a  tree  T″  in  which  x  and  y  are  sibling  leaves  of
maximum depth. (Note that if x = b but y ≠ a, then tree T ″ does not
have  x  and  y  as  sibling  leaves  of  maximum  depth.  Because  we  assume
that  x  ≠  b,  this  situation  cannot  occur.)  By  equation  (15.4),  the
difference in cost between T and T′ is

because both a.freq − x.freq and dT (a) − dT (x) are nonnegative. More
speciﬁcally,  a.freq  −  x.freq  is  nonnegative  because  x  is  a  minimum-
frequency leaf, and dT (a) − dT (x) is nonnegative because a is a leaf of
maximum  depth  in  T.  Similarly,  exchanging  y  and  b  does  not  increase
the cost, and so B(T′) − B(T ″) is nonnegative. Therefore, B(T ″) ≤ B(T′)
≤ B(T), and since T is optimal, we have B(T) ≤ B(T ″), which implies B(T
″)  =  B(T).  Thus,  T  ″  is  an  optimal  tree  in  which  x  and  y  appear  as
sibling leaves of maximum depth, from which the lemma follows.

▪

Lemma 15.2 implies that the process of building up an optimal tree
by mergers can, without loss of generality, begin with the greedy choice
of  merging  together  those  two  characters  of  lowest  frequency.  Why  is
this a greedy choice? We can view the cost of a single merger as being
the  sum  of  the  frequencies  of  the  two  items  being  merged.  Exercise
15.3-4 shows that the total cost of the tree constructed equals the sum
of  the  costs  of  its  mergers.  Of  all  possible  mergers  at  each  step,
HUFFMAN chooses the one that incurs the least cost.

The  next  lemma  shows  that  the  problem  of  constructing  optimal

preﬁx-free codes has the optimal-substructure property.

Lemma  15.3  (Optimal  preﬁx-free  codes  have  the  optimal-substructure
property)
Let  C  be  a  given  alphabet  with  frequency  c.freq  deﬁned  for  each
character  c  ∈  C.  Let  x  and  y  be  two  characters  in  C  with  minimum
frequency. Let C′ be the alphabet C with the characters x and y removed
and  a  new  character  z  added,  so  that  C′  =  (C  −  {x,  y})  ∪  {z}.  Deﬁne
freq  for  all  characters  in  C′  with  the  same  values  as  in  C,  along  with
z.freq  =  x.freq  +  y.freq.  Let  T′  be  any  tree  representing  an  optimal
preﬁx-free  code  for  alphabet  C′.  Then  the  tree  T,  obtained  from  T′  by
replacing  the  leaf  node  for  z  with  an  internal  node  having  x  and  y  as
children, represents an optimal preﬁx-free code for the alphabet C.

Proof   We ﬁrst show how to express the cost B(T) of tree T in terms of
the  cost  B(T′)  of  tree  T′,  by  considering  the  component  costs  in
equation (15.4). For each character c ∈ C − {x, y}, we have that dT (c)

= dT′ (c), and hence c.freq · dT (c) = c.freq · dT′ (c). Since dT (x) = dT
(y) = dT′ (z) + 1, we have

x.freq · dT (x) + y.freq · dT (y) = (x.freq + y.freq)(dT′ (z) + 1)

= z.freq · dT′(z)+ (x.freq + y.freq),

from which we conclude that

B(T) = B(T′) + x.freq + y.freq
or, equivalently,

B(T′) = B(T) − x.freq − y.freq.

We now prove the lemma by contradiction. Suppose that T does not
represent an optimal preﬁx-free code for C. Then there exists an optimal
tree T″ such that B(T″) < B(T). Without loss of generality (by Lemma
15.2), T″ has x and y as siblings. Let T″′ be the tree T″ with the common
parent of x and y replaced by a leaf z with frequency z.freq = x.freq +
y.freq. Then

B(T‴) = B(T″) − x.freq − y.freq
< B(T) − x.freq − y.freq
= B(T′),

yielding a contradiction to the assumption that T′ represents an optimal
preﬁx-free  code  for  C′.  Thus,  T  must  represent  an  optimal  preﬁx-free
code for the alphabet C.

15.4    Ofﬂine caching

Computer  systems  can  decrease  the  time  to  access  data  by  storing  a
subset of the main memory in the cache: a small but faster memory. A
cache  organizes  data  into  cache  blocks  typically  comprising  32,  64,  or
128  bytes.  You  can  also  think  of  main  memory  as  a  cache  for  disk-
resident  data  in  a  virtual-memory  system.  Here,  the  blocks  are  called
pages, and 4096 bytes is a typical size.

As  a  computer  program  executes,  it  makes  a  sequence  of  memory
requests. Say that there are n memory requests, to data in blocks b1, b2,
…  ,  bn,  in  that  order.  The  blocks  in  the  access  sequence  might  not  be
distinct, and indeed, any given block is usually accessed multiple times.
For example, a program that accesses four distinct blocks p, q, r, s might
make a sequence of requests to blocks s, q, s, q, q, s, p, p, r, s, s, q, p, r,
q.  The  cache  can  hold  up  to  some  ﬁxed  number  k  of  cache  blocks.  It
starts  out  empty  before  the  ﬁrst  request.  Each  request  causes  at  most
one block to enter the cache and at most one block to be evicted from
the cache. Upon a request for block bi, any one of three scenarios may
occur:

1. Block bi is already in the cache, due to a previous request for the
same  block.  The  cache  remains  unchanged.  This  situation  is
known as a cache hit.

2. Block bi is not in the cache at that time, but the cache contains
fewer  than  k  blocks.  In  this  case,  block  bi  is  placed  into  the

cache,  so  that  the  cache  contains  one  more  block  than  it  did
before the request.

3. Block bi is not in the cache at that time and the cache is full: it
contains  k  blocks.  Block  bi  is  placed  into  the  cache,  but  before
that  happens,  some  other  block  in  the  cache  must  be  evicted
from the cache in order to make room.

The latter two situations, in which the requested block is not already
in the cache, are called cache misses. The goal is to minimize the number
of cache misses or, equivalently, to maximize the number of cache hits,
over  the  entire  sequence  of  n  requests.  A  cache  miss  that  occurs  while
the cache holds fewer than k blocks—that is, as the cache is ﬁrst being
ﬁlled up—is known as a compulsory miss, since no prior decision could
have  kept  the  requested  block  in  the  cache.  When  a  cache  miss  occurs
and the cache is full, ideally the choice of which block to evict should
allow  for  the  smallest  possible  number  of  cache  misses  over  the  entire
sequence of future requests.

Typically, caching is an online problem. That is, the computer has to
decide  which  blocks  to  keep  in  the  cache  without  knowing  the  future
requests.  Here,  however,  let’s  consider  the  ofﬂine  version  of  this
problem, in which the computer knows in advance the entire sequence
of n requests and the cache size k, with a goal of minimizing the total
number of cache misses.

To  solve  this  ofﬂine  problem,  you  can  use  a  greedy  strategy  called
furthest-in-future,  which  chooses  to  evict  the  block  in  the  cache  whose
next  access  in  the  request  sequence  comes  furthest  in  the  future.
Intuitively,  this  strategy  makes  sense:  if  you’re  not  going  to  need
something for a while, why keep it around? We’ll show that the furthest-
in-future strategy is indeed optimal by showing that the ofﬂine caching
problem  exhibits  optimal  substructure  and  that  furthest-in-future  has
the greedy-choice property.

Now, you might be thinking that since the computer usually doesn’t
know the sequence of requests in advance, there is no point in studying
the ofﬂine problem. Actually, there is. In some situations, you do know
the sequence of requests in advance. For example, if you view the main

memory as the cache and the full set of data as residing on disk (or a
solid-state  drive),  there  are  algorithms  that  plan  out  the  entire  set  of
reads  and  writes  in  advance.  Furthermore,  we  can  use  the  number  of
cache  misses  produced  by  an  optimal  algorithm  as  a  baseline  for
comparing  how  well  online  algorithms  perform.  We’ll  do  just  that  in
Section 27.3.

Ofﬂine  caching  can  even  model  real-world  problems.  For  example,
consider  a  scenario  where  you  know  in  advance  a  ﬁxed  schedule  of  n
events  at  known  locations.  Events  may  occur  at  a  location  multiple
times,  not  necessarily  consecutively.  You  are  managing  a  group  of  k
agents,  you  need  to  ensure  that  you  have  one  agent  at  each  location
when an event occurs, and you want to minimize the number of times
that agents have to move. Here, the agents are like the blocks, the events
are like the requests, and moving an agent is akin to a cache miss.

Optimal substructure of ofﬂine caching

To  show  that  the  ofﬂine  problem  exhibits  optimal  substructure,  let’s
deﬁne the subproblem (C, i) as processing requests for blocks bi, bi+1,
… , bn with cache conﬁguration C at the time that the request for block
bi occurs, that is, C is a subset of the set of blocks such that |C | ≤ k. A
solution  to  subproblem  (C,  i)  is  a  sequence  of  decisions  that  speciﬁes
which block to evict (if any) upon each request for blocks bi, bi+1, … ,
bn. An optimal solution to subproblem (C, i) minimizes the number of
cache misses.

Consider  an  optimal  solution  S  to  subproblem  (C,  i),  and  let  C′  be
the  contents  of  the  cache  after  processing  the  request  for  block  bi  in
solution S. Let S′ be the subsolution of S for the resulting subproblem
(C′,  i  +  1).  If  the  request  for  bi  results  in  a  cache  hit,  then  the  cache
remains unchanged, so that C′ = C. If the request for block bi results in
a cache miss, then the contents of the cache change, so that C′ ≠ C. We
claim that in either case, S′ is an optimal solution to subproblem (C′, i +
1). Why? If S′ is not an optimal solution to subproblem (C′, i + 1), then
there  exists  another  solution  S″  to  subproblem  (C′,  i  +  1)  that  makes
fewer cache misses than S′. Combining S″ with the decision of S at the

request  for  block  bi  yields  another  solution  that  makes  fewer  cache
misses  than  S,  which  contradicts  the  assumption  that  S  is  an  optimal
solution to subproblem (C, i).

To quantify a recursive solution, we need a little more notation. Let
RC,i be the set of all cache conﬁgurations that can immediately follow
conﬁguration  C  after  processing  a  request  for  block  bi.  If  the  request
results in a cache hit, then the cache remains unchanged, so that RC,i =
{C  }.  If  the  request  for  bi  results  in  a  cache  miss,  then  there  are  two
possibilities. If the cache is not full (|C | < k), then the cache is ﬁlling up
and  the  only  choice  is  to  insert  bi  into  the  cache,  so  that  RC,i=  {C  ∪
{bi}}.  If  the  cache  is  full  (|C  |  =  k)  upon  a  cache  miss,  then  RC,i
contains  k  potential  conﬁgurations:  one  for  each  candidate  block  in  C
that could be evicted and replaced by block bi. In this case, RC,i = {(C
− {x}) ∪ {bi} : x ∈ C }. For example, if C = {p, q, r}, k = 3, and block s
is requested, then RC,i = {{p, q, s},{p, r, s},{q, r, s}}.

Let  miss(C,  i)  denote  the  minimum  number  of  cache  misses  in  a

solution for subproblem (C, i). Here is a recurrence for miss(C, i):

Greedy-choice property

To prove that the furthest-in-future strategy yields an optimal solution,
we need to show that optimal ofﬂine caching exhibits the greedy-choice
property. Combined with the optimal-substructure property, the greedy-
choice  property  will  prove  that  furthest-in-future  produces  the
minimum possible number of cache misses.

Theorem 15.5 (Optimal ofﬂine caching has the greedy-choice property)
Consider  a  subproblem  (C,  i)  when  the  cache  C  contains  k  blocks,  so
that it is full, and a cache miss occurs. When block bi is requested, let z

=  bm  be  the  block  in  C  whose  next  access  is  furthest  in  the  future.  (If
some  block  in  the  cache  will  never  again  be  referenced,  then  consider
any such block to be block z, and add a dummy request for block z =
bm  =  bn+1.)  Then  evicting  block  z  upon  a  request  for  block  bi  is
included in some optimal solution for the subproblem (C, i).

Proof      Let  S  be  an  optimal  solution  to  subproblem  (C,  i).  If  S  evicts
block z upon the request for block bi, then we are done, since we have
shown that some optimal solution includes evicting z.

So  now  suppose  that  optimal  solution  S  evicts  some  other  block  x
when  block  bi  is  requested.  We’ll  construct  another  solution  S′  to
subproblem (C, i) which, upon the request for bi, evicts block z instead
of  x  and  induces  no  more  cache  misses  than  S  does,  so  that  S′  is  also
optimal.  Because  different  solutions  may  yield  different  cache
conﬁgurations,  denote  by  CS,j  the  conﬁguration  of  the  cache  under
solution  S  just  before  the  request  for  some  block  bj,  and  likewise  for
solution S′ and CS′,j. We’ll show how to construct S′ with the following
properties:

1. For j = i + 1, … , m, let Dj = CS,j ∩ CS′,j. Then, |Dj | ≥ k − 1, so
that  the  cache  conﬁgurations  CS,j  and  CS′,j  differ  by  at  most
one block. If they differ, then CS,j = Dj ∪ {z} and CS′,j = Dj ∪
{y} for some block y ≠ z.

2. For  each  request  of  blocks  bi,  …  ,  bm−1,  if  solution  S  has  a

cache hit, then solution S′ also has a cache hit.

3. For  all  j  >  m,  the  cache  conﬁgurations  CS,j  and  CS′,j  are

identical.

4. Over the sequence of requests for blocks bi, … , bm, the number
of cache misses produced by solution S′ is at most the number of
cache misses produced by solution S.

We’ll prove inductively that these properties hold for each request.

1. We proceed by induction on j, for j = i +1, … , m. For the base
case,  the  initial  caches  CS,i  and  CS′,i  are  identical.  Upon  the
request for block bi, solution S evicts x and solution S′ evicts z.
Thus, cache conﬁgurations CS,i+1 and CS′,i+1 differ by just one
block, CS,i+1 = Di+1 ∪ {z}, CS′,i+1 = Di+1 ∪ {x}, and x ≠ z.
The  inductive  step  deﬁnes  how  solution  S′  behaves  upon  a
request  for  block  bj  for  i  +  1  ≤  j  ≤  m  −  1.  The  inductive
hypothesis is that property 1 holds when bj is requested. Because
z = bm is the block in CS,i whose next reference is furthest in the
future, we know that bj ≠ z. We consider several scenarios:

If CS,j = CS′,j (so that |Dj | = k), then solution S′ makes
the  same  decision  upon  the  request  for  bj  as  S  makes,  so
that CS,j+1 = CS′,j+1.
If  |Dj|  =  k  −  1  and  bj  ∈  Dj,  then  both  caches  already
contain  block  bj,  and  both  solutions  S  and  S′  have  cache
hits. Therefore, CS,j+1 = CS,j and CS′,j+1 = CS′,j.
If |Dj | = k − 1 and bj ∉ Dj, then because CS,j = Dj ∪ {z}
and  bj  ≠  z,  solution  S  has  a  cache  miss.  It  evicts  either
block z or some block w ∈ Dj.

If solution S evicts block z, then CS,j+1 = Dj ∪ {bj}.
There are two cases, depending on whether bj = y:

If  bj  =  y,  then  solution  S′  has  a  cache  hit,  so
that CS′,j+1 = CS′,j = Dj ∪ {bj}. Thus, CS,j+1
= CS′,j +1.
If bj ≠ y, then solution S′ has a cache miss. It
evicts  block  y,  so  that  CS′,j+1  =  Dj  ∪  {bj  },
and again CS,j+1 = CS′,j+1.

If solution S evicts some block w ∈ Dj, then CS,j+1
=  (Dj  −  {w})  ∪  {bj,  z}.  Once  again,  there  are  two

cases, depending on whether bj = y:

If  bj  =  y,  then  solution  S′  has  a  cache  hit,  so
that CS′,j+1 = CS′,j = Dj ∪ {bj}. Since w ∈ Dj
and w was not evicted by solution S′, we have
w ∈ CS′,j +1. Therefore, w ∉ Dj+1 and bj ∈
Dj+1, so that Dj+1 = (Dj − {w}) ∪ {bj }. Thus,
CS,j+1 = Dj+1 ∪ {z},CS′,j+1 = Dj +1 ∪ {w},
and  because  w  ≠  z,  property  1  holds  when
block bj+1 is requested. (In other words, block
w replaces block y in property 1.)
If bj ≠ y, then solution S′ has a cache miss. It
evicts block w, so that CS′,j +1 = (Dj − {w}) ∪
{bj, y}. Therefore, we have that Dj+1 = (Dj −
{w}) ∪ {bj } and so CS,j+1 = Dj+1 ∪ {z} and
CS′,j+1 = Dj +1 ∪ {y}.
2. In the above discussion about maintaining property 1, solution S
may have a cache hit in only the ﬁrst two cases, and solution S′
has a cache hit in these cases if and only if S does.

3. If CS,m = CS′,m, then solution S′ makes the same decision upon
the  request  for  block  z  =  bm  as  S  makes,  so  that  CS,m+1  =
CS′,m+1. If CS,m ≠ CS′,m, then by property 1, CS,m = Dm∪{z}
and CS′,m = Dm∪{y}, where y ≠ z. In this case, solution S has a
cache  hit,  so  that  CS,m+1  =  CS,m  =  Dm  ∪  {z}.  Solution  S′
evicts  block  y  and  brings  in  block  z,  so  that  CS′,m+1  =  Dm  ∪
{z}  =  CS,m+1.  Thus,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  CS,m  =
CS′,m,  we  have  CS,m+1  =  CS′,m+1,  and  starting  with  the
request  for  block  bm+1,  solution  S′  simply  makes  the  same
decisions as S.

4. By  property  2,  upon  the  requests  for  blocks  bi,  …  ,  bm−1,
whenever solution S has a cache hit, so does S′. Only the request

for block bm = z remains to be considered. If S has a cache miss
upon  the  request  for  bm,  then  regardless  of  whether  S′  has  a
cache hit or a cache miss, we are done: S′ has at most the same
number of cache misses as S.
So now suppose that S has a cache hit and S′ has a cache miss
upon  the  request  for  bm.  We’ll  show  that  there  exists  a  request
for  at  least  one  of  blocks  bi+1,  …  ,  bm−1  in  which  the  request
results  in  a  cache  miss  for  S  and  a  cache  hit  for  S′,  thereby
compensating for what happens upon the request for block bm.
The proof is by contradiction. Assume that no request for blocks
bi+1, … , bm−1 results in a cache miss for S and a cache hit for
S′.
We  start  by  observing  that  once  the  caches  CS,j  and  CS′j  are
equal for some j > i, they remain equal thereafter. Observe also
that  if  bm  ∈  CS,m  and  bm  ∉  CS′,m,  then  CS,m  ≠  CS′,m.
Therefore,  solution  S  cannot  have  evicted  block  z  upon  the
requests  for  blocks  bi,  …  ,  bm−1,  for  if  it  had,  then  these  two
cache  conﬁgurations  would  be  equal.  The  remaining  possibility
is  that  upon  each  of  these  requests,  we  had  CS,j  =  Dj  ∪  {z},
CS′,j  =  Dj  ∪  {y}  for  some  block  y  ≠  z,  and  solution  S  evicted
some  block  w  ∈  Dj.  Moreover,  since  none  of  these  requests
resulted in a cache miss for S and a cache hit for S′, the case of
bj = y never occurred. That is, for every request of blocks bi+1,
… , bm−1, the requested block bj was never the block y ∈ CS′,j
− CS,j. In these cases, after processing the request, we had CS′,j
+1 = Dj +1 ∪ {y}: the difference between the two caches did not
change.  Now,  let’s  go  back  to  the  request  for  block  bi,  where
afterward,  we  had  CS′,i+1  =  Di+1  ∪  {x}.  Because  every
succeeding request until requesting block bm did not change the

difference between the caches, we had CS′,j = Dj ∪ {x} for j = i
+ 1, … , m.
By  deﬁnition,  block  z  =  bm  is  requested  after  block  x.  That
means at least one of blocks bi+1, … , bm−1 is block x. But for j
= i + 1, … , m, we have x ∈ CS′,j and x ∉ CS,j, so that at least
one of these requests had a cache hit for S′ and a cache miss for
S, a contradiction. We conclude that if solution S has a cache hit
and solution S′ has a cache miss upon the request for block bm,
then  some  earlier  request  had  the  opposite  result,  and  so
solution  S′  produces  no  more  cache  misses  than  solution  S.
Since S is assumed to be optimal, S′ is optimal as well.

Along with the optimal-substructure property, Theorem 15.5 tells us
that the furthest-in-future strategy yields the minimum number of cache
misses.

Exercises

15.4-1
Write  pseudocode  for  a  cache  manager  that  uses  the  furthest-in-future
strategy.  It  should  take  as  input  a  set  C  of  blocks  in  the  cache,  the
number of blocks k that the cache can hold, a sequence b1, b2, … , bn
of requested blocks, and the index i into the sequence for the block bi
being requested. For each request, it should print out whether a cache
hit  or  cache  miss  occurs,  and  for  each  cache  miss,  it  should  also  print
out which block, if any, is evicted.

15.4-2
Real cache managers do not know the future requests, and so they often
use  the  past  to  decide  which  block  to  evict.  The  least-recently-used,  or
LRU, strategy evicts the block that, of all blocks currently in the cache,
was the least recently requested. (You can think of LRU as “furthest-in-
past.”)  Give  an  example  of  a  request  sequence  in  which  the  LRU

strategy  is  not  optimal,  by  showing  that  it  induces  more  cache  misses
than the furthest-in-future strategy does on the same request sequence.

15.4-3
Professor Croesus suggests that in the proof of Theorem 15.5, the last
clause  in  property  1  can  change  to  CS′,j  =  Dj  ∪  {x}  or,  equivalently,
require the block y given in property 1 to always be the block x evicted
by  solution  S  upon  the  request  for  block  bi.  Show  where  the  proof
breaks down with this requirement.

15.4-4
This section has assumed that at most one block is placed into the cache
whenever a block is requested. You can imagine, however, a strategy in
which multiple blocks may enter the cache upon a single request. Show
that  for  every  solution  that  allows  multiple  blocks  to  enter  the  cache
upon  each  request,  there  is  another  solution  that  brings  in  only  one
block upon each request and is at least as good.

not yield an optimal solution. Your set should include a penny so that
there is a solution for every value of n.

d. Give an O(nk)-time algorithm that makes change for any set of k
different coin denominations using the smallest number of coins,
assuming that one of the coins is a penny.

15-2     Scheduling to minimize average completion time
You are given a set S = {a1, a2, … , an} of tasks, where task ai requires
pi units of processing time to complete. Let Ci be the completion time of
task  ai,  that  is,  the  time  at  which  task  ai  completes  processing.  Your
goal  is  to  minimize  the  average  completion  time,  that  is,  to  minimize
.  For  example,  suppose  that  there  are  two  tasks  a1  and  a2
with p1 = 3 and p2 = 5, and consider the schedule in which a2 runs ﬁrst,
followed  by  a1.  Then  we  have  C2  =  5,  C1  =  8,  and  the  average
completion time is (5 + 8)/2 = 6.5. If task a1 runs ﬁrst, however, then we
have C1 = 3, C2 = 8, and the average completion time is (3 + 8)/2 = 5.5.

a. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize the

average completion time. Each task must run nonpreemptively, that is,
once task ai starts, it must run continuously for pi units of time until it
is done. Prove that your algorithm minimizes the average completion
time, and analyze the running time of your algorithm.

b. Suppose now that the tasks are not all available at once. That is, each
task cannot start until its release time bi. Suppose also that tasks may
be preempted, so that a task can be suspended and restarted at a later
time. For example, a task ai with processing time pi = 6 and release
time bi = 1 might start running at time 1 and be preempted at time 4.
It might then resume at time 10 but be preempted at time 11, and it
might ﬁnally resume at time 13 and complete at time 15. Task ai has
run for a total of 6 time units, but its running time has been divided
into three pieces. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to
minimize the average completion time in this new scenario. Prove that
your algorithm minimizes the average completion time, and analyze
the running time of your algorithm.

Chapter notes

Much more material on greedy algorithms can be found in Lawler [276]
and  Papadimitriou  and  Steiglitz  [353].  The  greedy  algorithm  ﬁrst
appeared  in  the  combinatorial  optimization  literature  in  a  1971  article
by Edmonds [131].

The  proof  of  correctness  of  the  greedy  algorithm  for  the  activity-

selection problem is based on that of Gavril [179].

Huffman codes were invented in 1952 [233]. Lelewer and Hirschberg

[294] surveys data-compression techniques known as of 1987.

The  furthest-in-future  strategy  was  proposed  by  Belady  [41],  who
suggested  it  for  virtual-memory  systems.  Alternative  proofs  that
furthest-in-future  is  optimal  appear  in  articles  by  Lee  et  al.  [284]  and
Van Roy [443].

1  We  sometimes  refer  to  the  sets  Sk  as  subproblems  rather  than  as  just  sets  of  activities.  The
context will make it clear whether we are referring to Sk as a set of activities or as a subproblem
whose input is that set.
2  Because  the  pseudocode  takes  s  and  f  as  arrays,  it  indexes  into  them  with  square  brackets
rather than with subscripts.
