33        Machine-Learning Algorithms

Machine learning may be viewed as a subﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence.
Broadly  speaking,  artiﬁcial  intelligence  aims  to  enable  computers  to
carry  out  complex  perception  and  information-processing  tasks  with
human-like performance. The ﬁeld of AI is vast and uses many different
algorithmic methods.

Machine learning is rich and fascinating, with strong ties to statistics
and  optimization.  Technology  today  produces  enormous  amounts  of
data,  providing  myriad  opportunities  for  machine-learning  algorithms
to formulate and test hypotheses about patterns within the data. These
hypotheses  can  then  be  used  to  make  predictions  about  the
characteristics or classiﬁcations in new data. Because machine learning
is particularly good with challenging tasks involving uncertainty, where
observed  data  follows  unknown  rules,  it  has  markedly  transformed
ﬁelds such as medicine, advertising, and speech recognition.

This chapter presents three important machine-learning algorithms:
k-means  clustering,  multiplicative  weights,  and  gradient  descent.  You
can  view  each  of  these  tasks  as  a  learning  problem,  whereby  an
algorithm  uses  the  data  collected  so  far  to  produce  a  hypothesis  that
describes  the  regularities  learned  and/or  makes  predictions  about  new
data. The boundaries of machine learning are imprecise and evolving—
some might say that the k-means clustering algorithm should be called
“data  science”  and  not  “machine  learning,”  and  gradient  descent,
though  an  immensely  important  algorithm  for  machine  learning,  also
has  a  multitude  of  applications  outside  of  machine  learning  (most
notably for optimization problems).

Machine learning typically starts with a training phase followed by a
prediction  phase  in  which  predictions  are  made  about  new  data.  For
online learning, the training and prediction phases are intermingled. The
training phase takes as input training data, where each input data point
has an associated output or label; the label might be a category name or
some  real-valued  attribute.  It  then  produces  as  an  output  one  or  more
hypotheses  about  how  the  labels  depend  on  the  attributes  of  the  input
data  points.  Hypotheses  can  take  many  forms,  typically  some  type  of
formula  or  algorithm.  The  learning  algorithm  used  is  often  a  form  of
gradient descent. The prediction phase then uses the hypothesis on new
data  in  order  to  make  predictions  regarding  the  labels  of  new  data
points.

The type of learning just described is known as supervised learning,
since it starts with a set of inputs that are each labeled. As an example,
consider  a  machine-learning  algorithm  to  recognize  spam  emails.  The
training data comprises a collection of emails, each of which is labeled
either “spam” or “not spam.” The machine-learning algorithm frames a
hypothesis, possibly a rule of the form “if an email has one of a set of
words, then it is likely to be spam.” Or it might learn rules that assign a
spam score to each word and then evaluates a document by the sum of
the  spam  scores  of  its  constituent  words,  so  that  a  document  with  a
total  score  above  a  certain  threshold  value  is  classiﬁed  as  spam.  The
machine-learning  algorithm  can  then  predict  whether  a  new  email  is
spam or not.

A  second  form  of  machine  learning  is  unsupervised  learning,  where
the  training  data  is  unlabeled,  as  in  the  clustering  problem  of  Section
33.1.  Here  the  machine-learning  algorithm  produces  hypotheses
regarding the centers of groups of input data points.

A  third  form  of  machine  learning  (not  covered  further  here)  is
reinforcement  learning,  where  the  machine-learning  algorithm  takes
actions in an environment, receives feedback for those actions from the
environment, and then updates its model of the environment based on
the feedback. The learner is in an environment that has some state, and
the  actions  of  the  learner  have  an  effect  on  that  state.  Reinforcement
learning  is  a  natural  choice  for  situations  such  as  game  playing  or
operating a self-driving car.

Sometimes  the  goal  in  a  supervised  machine-learning  application  is
not making accurate predictions of labels for new examples, but rather
performing  causal
inference:  ﬁnding  an  explanatory  model  that
describes  how  the  various  features  of  an  input  data  point  affect  its
associated  label.  Finding  a  model  that  ﬁts  a  given  set  of  training  data
well  can  be  tricky.  It  may  involve  sophisticated  optimization  methods
that  need  to  balance  between  producing  a  hypothesis  that  ﬁts  the  data
well and producing a hypothesis that is simple.

This  chapter  focuses  on  three  problem  domains:  ﬁnding  hypotheses
that  group  the  input  data  points  well  (using  a  clustering  algorithm),
learning which predictors (experts) to rely upon for making predictions
learning  problem  (using  the  multiplicative-weights
in  an  online
algorithm), and ﬁtting a model to data (using gradient descent).

Section 33.1 considers the clustering problem: how to divide a given
set  of  n  training  data  points  into  a  given  number  k  of  groups,  or
“clusters,” based on a measure of how similar (or more accurately, how
dissimilar) points are to each other. The approach is iterative, beginning
incorporating  successive
with  an  arbitrary
improvements until no further improvements occur. Clustering is often
used as an initial step when working on a machine-learning problem to
discover what structure exists in the data.

initial  clustering  and

Section 33.2 shows how to make online predictions quite accurately
when  you  have  a  set  of  predictors,  often  called  “experts,”  to  rely  on,
many of which might be poor predictors, but some of which are good
predictors.  At  ﬁrst,  you  do  not  know  which  predictors  are  poor  and
which are good. The goal is to make predictions on new examples that
are  nearly  as  good  as  the  predictions  made  by  the  best  predictor.  We
study  an  effective  multiplicative-weights  prediction  method  that
associates a positive real weight with each predictor and multiplicatively
decreases  the  weights  associated  with  predictors  when  they  make  poor
predictions. The model in this section is online (see Chapter 27): at each
step, we do not know anything about the future examples. In addition,
we  are  able  to  make  predictions  even  in  the  presence  of  adversarial
experts,  who  are  collaborating  against  us,  a  situation  that  actually
happens in game-playing settings.

Finally,  Section  33.3  introduces  gradient  descent,  a  powerful
optimization  technique  used  to  ﬁnd  parameter  settings  in  machine-
learning  models.  Gradient  descent  also  has  many  applications  outside
of  machine  learning.  Intuitively,  gradient  descent  ﬁnds  the  value  that
produces  a  local  minimum  for  a  function  by  “walking  downhill.”  In  a
learning application, a “downhill step” is a step that adjusts hypothesis
parameters so that the hypothesis does better on the given set of labeled
examples.

This  chapter  makes  extensive  use  of  vectors.  In  contrast  to  the  rest
of the book, vector names in this chapter appear in boldface, such as x,
to  more  clearly  delineate  which  quantities  are  vectors.  Components  of
vectors do not appear in boldface, so if vector x has d dimensions, we
might write x = (x1, x2, …, xd).

33.1    Clustering

Suppose  that  you  have  a  large  number  of  data  points  (examples),  and
you  wish  to  group  them  into  classes  based  on  how  similar  they  are  to
each other. For example, each data point might represent a celestial star,
giving  its  temperature,  size,  and  spectral  characteristics.  Or,  each  data
point  might  represent  a  fragment  of  recorded  speech.  Grouping  these
speech  fragments  appropriately  might  reveal  the  set  of  accents  of  the
fragments.  Once  a  grouping  of  the  training  data  points  is  found,  new
data  can  be  placed  into  an  appropriate  group,  facilitating  star-type
recognition or speech recognition.

These situations, along with many others, fall under the umbrella of
clustering.  The  input  to  a  clustering  problem  is  a  set  of  n  examples
(objects) and an integer k, with the goal of dividing the examples into at
most  k  disjoint  clusters  such  that  the  examples  in  each  cluster  are
similar to each other. The clustering problem has several variations. For
example, the integer k might not be given, but instead arises out of the
clustering procedure. In this section we presume that k is given.

Feature vectors and similarity

Let’s  formally  deﬁne  the  clustering  problem.  The  input  is  a  set  of
n  examples.  Each  example  has  a  set  of  attributes  in  common  with  all
other examples, though the attribute values may vary among examples.
For example, the clustering problem shown in Figure 33.1 clusters n =
49 examples—48 state capitals plus the District of Columbia—into k =
4 clusters. Each example has two attributes: the latitude and longitude
of  the  capital.  In  a  given  clustering  problem,  each  example  has  d
attributes, with an example x speciﬁed by a d-dimensional feature vector

x = (x1, x2, …, xd).

Here, xa for a = 1, 2, …, d is a real number giving the value of attribute
d representing the example. For
a for example x. We call x the point in ℝ
the example in Figure 33.1, each capital x has its latitude in x1 and its
longitude in x2.

In  order  to  cluster  similar  points  together,  we  need  to  deﬁne
similarity.  Instead,  let’s  deﬁne  the  opposite:  the  dissimilarity  Δ(x,  y)  of
points x and y is the squared Euclidean distance between them:

Of  course,  for  Δ(x,  y)  to  be  well  deﬁned,  all  attribute  values  must  be
present. If any are missing, then you might just ignore that example, or
you could ﬁll in a missing attribute value with the median value for that
attribute.

The  attribute  values  are  often  “messy”  in  other  ways,  so  that  some
“data cleaning” is necessary before the clustering algorithm is run. For
example, the scale of attribute values can vary widely across attributes.
In the example of Figure 33.1, the scales of the two attributes vary by a
factor of 2, since latitude ranges from −90 to +90 degrees but longitude
ranges  from  −180  to  +180  degrees.  You  can  imagine  other  scenarios
where the differences in scales are even greater. If the examples contain
information about students, one attribute might be grade-point average
but another might be family income. Therefore, the attribute values are

usually  scaled  or  normalized,  so  that  no  single  attribute  can  dominate
the  others  when  computing  dissimilarities.  One  way  to  do  so  is  by
scaling  attribute  values  with  a  linear  transform  so  that  the  minimum
value  becomes  0  and  the  maximum  value  becomes  1.  If  the  attribute
values  are  binary  values,  then  no  scaling  may  be  needed.  Another
option is scaling so that the values for each attribute have mean 0 and
unit variance. Sometimes it makes sense to choose the same scaling rule
for several related attributes (for example, if they are lengths measured
to the same scale).

Figure  33.1  The  iterations  of  Lloyd’s  procedure  when  clustering  the  capitals  of  the  lower  48
states and the District of Columbia into k = 4 clusters. Each capital has two attributes: latitude
and longitude. Each iteration reduces the value f, measuring the sum of squares of distances of
all  capitals  to  their  cluster  centers,  until  the  value  of  f  does  not  change.  (a)  The  initial  four
clusters, with the capitals of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee chosen as centers. (b)–
(k)  Iterations  of  Lloyd’s  procedure.  (l)  The  11th  iteration  results  in  the  same  value  of  f  as  the
10th iteration in part (k), and so the procedure terminates.

Also, the choice of dissimilarity measure is somewhat arbitrary. The
use  of  the  sum  of  squared  differences  as  in  equation  (33.1)  is  not

required, but it is a conventional choice and mathematically convenient.
For  the  example  of  Figure  33.1,  you  might  use  the  actual  distance
between capitals rather than equation (33.1).

Clusterings

With  the  notion  of  similarity  (actually,  dissimilarity)  deﬁned,  let’s  see
how to deﬁne clusters of similar points. Let S denote the given set of n
d.  In  some  applications  the  points  are  not  necessarily
points  in  ℝ
distinct, so that S is a multiset rather than a set.

Because the goal is to create k clusters, we deﬁne a k-clustering of S
as  a  decomposition  of  S  into  a  sequence  〈S(1),  S(2),  …,  S(k)〉  of  k
disjoint subsets, or clusters, so that
S = S(1) ⋃ S(2) ⋃ ⋯ ⋃ S(k).
A cluster may be empty, for example if k > 1 but all of the points in S
have the same attribute values.

There are many ways to deﬁne a k-clustering of S and many ways to
evaluate  the  quality  of  a  given  k-clustering.  We  consider  here  only  k-
clusterings of S that are deﬁned by a sequence C of k centers

C = 〈c(1), c(2), …, c(k)〉,

d, and the nearest-center rule says that
where each center is a point in ℝ
a point x may belong to cluster S(ℓ) if the center of no other cluster is
closer to x than the center c(ℓ) of S(ℓ):
x ∈ S(ℓ) only if Δ(x, c(ℓ)) = min {Δ(x, c(j)): 1 ≤ j ≤ k}.
A center can be anywhere, and not necessarily a point in S.

Ties  are  possible  and  must  be  broken  so  that  each  point  lies  in
exactly one cluster. In general, ties may be broken arbitrarily, although
we’ll need the property that we never change which cluster a point x is
assigned to unless the distance from x to its new cluster center is strictly
smaller than the distance from x to its old cluster center. That is, if the

current cluster has a center that is one of the closest cluster centers to x,
then don’t change which cluster x is assigned to.

The k-means problem is then the following: given a set S of n points
and a positive integer  k, ﬁnd a sequence  C = 〈c(1),  c(2), …, c(k)〉 of k
center points minimizing the sum f(S, C) of the squared distance from
each point to its nearest center, where

In the second line, the k-clustering 〈S(1),S(2),…,S(k)〉 is deﬁned by the
centers  C  and  the  nearest-center  rule.  See  Exercise  33.1-1  for  an
alternative formulation based on pairwise interpoint distances.

Is  there  a  polynomial-time  algorithm  for  the  k-means  problem?
Probably  not,  because  it  is  NP-hard  [310].  As  we’ll  see  in  Chapter  34,
NP-hard  problems  have  no  known  polynomial-time  algorithm,  but
nobody  has  ever  proven  that  polynomial-time  algorithms  for  NP-hard
problems  cannot  exist.  Although  we  know  of  no  polynomial-time
algorithm that ﬁnds the global minimum over all clusterings (according
to equation (33.2)), we can ﬁnd a local minimum.

Lloyd [304] proposed a simple procedure that ﬁnds a sequence C of k
centers that yields a local minimum of f(S, C). A local minimum in the
k-means  problem  satisﬁes  two  simple  properties:  each  cluster  has  an
optimal center (deﬁned below), and each point is assigned to the cluster
(or one of the clusters) with the closest center. Lloyd’s procedure ﬁnds a
good  clustering—possibly  optimal—that  satisﬁes  these  two  properties.
These properties are necessary, but not sufﬁcient, for optimality.

Optimal center for a given cluster

In an optimal solution to the k-means problem, each center point must
be the centroid, or mean, of the points in its cluster. The centroid is a d-
dimensional point, where the value in each dimension is the mean of the
values of all the points in the cluster in that dimension (that is, the mean

of  the  corresponding  attribute  values  in  the  cluster).  That  is,  if  c( ℓ )  is
the centroid for cluster S(ℓ), then for attributes a = 1, 2, …, d, we have

Over all attributes, we write

Theorem 33.1
Given  a  nonempty  cluster  S( ℓ ),  its  centroid  (or  mean)  is  the  unique
choice for the cluster center c(ℓ) ∈ ℝ

d that minimizes

Proof   We wish to minimize, by choosing c(ℓ) ∈ ℝ

d, the sum

For each attribute a, the term summed is a convex quadratic function in
 and

. To minimize this function, take its derivative with respect to

set it to 0:

or, equivalently,

Since the minimum is obtained uniquely when each coordinate of
 is
the  average  of  the  corresponding  coordinate  for  x  ∈  S( ℓ ),  the  overall

minimum  is  obtained  when  c( ℓ )  is  the  centroid  of  the  points  x,  as  in
equation (33.3).

▪

Optimal clusters for given centers

The  following  theorem  shows  that  the  nearest-center  rule—assigning
each point x to one of the clusters whose center is nearest to x—yields
an optimal solution to the k-means problem.

Theorem 33.2
Given  a  set  S  of  n  points  and  a  sequence  〈c(1),  c(2),  …,  c(k)〉  of  k
centers, a clustering 〈S(1), S(2), …, S(k)〉 minimizes

if and only if it assigns each point x ∈ S to a cluster S(ℓ) that minimizes
Δ(x, c(ℓ)).

Proof      The  proof  is  straightforward:  each  point  x  ∈  S  contributes
exactly once to the sum (33.4), and choosing to put x in a cluster whose
center is nearest minimizes the contribution from x.

▪

Lloyd’s procedure

Lloyd’s  procedure  just  iterates  two  operations—assigning  points  to
clusters  based  on  the  nearest-center  rule,  followed  by  recomputing  the
centers of clusters to be their centroids—until the results converge. Here
is Lloyd’s procedure:

Input: A set S of points in ℝ
Output:  A  k-clustering  〈S(1),  S(2),  …,  S(k)〉  of  S  with  a  sequence  of

d, and a positive integer k.

centers 〈c(1), c(2), …, c(k)〉.

1. Initialize  centers:  Generate  an  initial  sequence  〈c(1),  c(2),  …,
c(k)〉  of  k  centers  by  picking  k  points  independently  from  S  at
random.  (If  the  points  are  not  necessarily  distinct,  see  Exercise
33.1-3.) Assign all points to cluster S(1) to begin.

2. Assign points to clusters: Use the nearest-center rule to deﬁne the
clustering 〈S(1), S(2), …, S(k)〉. That is, assign each point x ∈ S
to a cluster S(ℓ) having a nearest center (breaking ties arbitrarily,
but  not  changing  the  assignment  for  a  point  x  unless  the  new
cluster center is strictly closer to x than the old one).

3. Stop  if  no  change:  If  step  2  did  not  change  the  assignments  of
any points to clusters, then stop and return the clustering 〈S(1),
S(2),  …,  S(k)〉  and  the  associated  centers  〈c(1),  c(2),  …,  c(k)〉.
Otherwise, go to step 4.

4. Recompute centers as centroids: For ℓ = 1, 2, …, k, compute the
center c(ℓ) of cluster S(ℓ) as the centroid of the points in S(ℓ). (If
S(ℓ) is empty, let c(ℓ) be the zero vector.) Then go to step 2.

It is possible for some of the clusters returned to be empty, particularly
if many of the input points are identical.

Lloyd’s procedure always terminates. By Theorem 33.1, recomputing
the  centers  of  each  cluster  as  the  cluster  centroid  cannot  increase  f(S,
C).  Lloyd’s  procedure  ensures  that  a  point  is  reassigned  to  a  different
cluster only when such an operation strictly decreases f(S, C). Thus each
iteration  of  Lloyd’s  procedure,  except  the  last  iteration,  must  strictly
decrease  f(S,  C).  Since  there  are  only  a  ﬁnite  number  of  possible  k-
clusterings  of  S  (at  most  kn),  the  procedure  must  terminate.
Furthermore, once one iteration of Lloyd’s procedure yields no decrease
in  f,  further  iterations  would  not  change  anything,  and  the  procedure
can stop at this locally optimum assignment of points to clusters.

If  Lloyd’s  procedure  really  required  kn  iterations,  it  would  be
impractical. In practice, it sometimes sufﬁces to terminate the procedure

when the percentage decrease in f(S, C) in the latest iteration falls below
a predetermined threshold. Because Lloyd’s procedure is guaranteed to
ﬁnd  only  a  locally  optimal  clustering,  one  approach  to  ﬁnding  a  good
clustering  is  to  run  Lloyd’s  procedure  many  times  with  different
randomly chosen initial centers, taking the best result.

The  running  time  of  Lloyd’s  procedure  is  proportional  to  the
number  T  of  iterations.  In  one  iteration,  assigning  points  to  clusters
based on the nearest-center rule requires O(dkn) time, and recomputing
new centers for each cluster requires O(dn) time (because each point is
in  one  cluster).  The  overall  running  time  of  the  k-means  procedure  is
thus O(Tdkn).

Lloyd’s  algorithm

illustrates  an  approach  common  to  many

machine-learning algorithms:

First, deﬁne a hypothesis space in terms an appropriate sequence
θ  of  parameters,  so  that  each  θ  is  associated  with  a  speciﬁc
hypothesis  hθ.  (For  the  k-means  problem,  θ  is  a  dk-dimensional
vector,  equivalent  to  C,  containing  the  d-dimensional  center  of
each  of  the  k  clusters,  and  hθ  is  the  hypothesis  that  each  data
point x should be grouped with a cluster having a center closest to
x.)
Second, deﬁne a measure f(E, θ) describing how poorly hypothesis
hθ  ﬁts  the  given  training  data  E.  Smaller  values  of  f(E,  θ)  are
better, and a (locally) optimal solution (locally) minimizes f(E, θ).
(For the k-means problem, f(E, θ) is just f(S, C).)
Third, given a set of training data E, use a suitable optimization
procedure  to  ﬁnd  a  value  of  θ*  that  minimizes  f(E,  θ*),  at  least
locally. (For the k-means problem, this value of θ* is the sequence
C of k center points returned by Lloyd’s algorithm.)
Return θ* as the answer.

In this framework, we see that optimization becomes a powerful tool for
machine  learning.  Using  optimization  in  this  way  is  ﬂexible.  For
example, regularization terms can be incorporated in the function to be
minimized, in order to penalize hypotheses that are “too complicated”

and that “overﬁt” the training data. (Regularization is a complex topic
that isn’t pursued further here.)

Examples

Figure 33.1 demonstrates Lloyd’s procedure on a set of n = 49 cities: 48
U.S.  state  capitals  and  the  District  of  Columbia.  Each  city  has  d  =  2
dimensions:  latitude  and  longitude.  The  initial  clustering  in  part  (a)  of
the ﬁgure has the initial cluster centers arbitrarily chosen as the capitals
of  Arkansas,  Kansas,  Louisiana,  and  Tennessee.  As  the  procedure
iterates, the value of the function f decreases, until the 11th iteration in
part  (l),  where  it  remains  the  same  as  in  the  10th  iteration  in  part  (k).
Lloyd’s procedure then terminates with the clusters shown in part (l).

As  Figure  33.2  shows,  Lloyd’s  procedure  can  also  apply  to  “vector
quantization.” Here, the goal is to reduce the number of distinct colors
required to represent a photograph, thereby allowing the photograph to
be  greatly  compressed  (albeit  in  a  lossy  manner).  In  part  (a)  of  the
ﬁgure, an original photograph 700 pixels wide and 500 pixels high uses
24 bits (three bytes) per pixel to encode a triple of red, green, and blue
(RGB)  primary  color  intensities.  Parts  (b)–(e)  of  the  ﬁgure  show  the
results of using Lloyd’s procedure to compress the picture from a initial
space of 224 possible values per pixel to a space of only k = 4, k = 16, k
= 64, or k = 256 possible values per pixel; these k values are the cluster
centers. The photograph can then be represented with only 2, 4, 6, or 8
bits per pixel, respectively, instead of the 24-bits per pixel needed by the
initial  photograph.  An  auxiliary  table,  the  “palette,”  accompanies  the
compressed  image;  it  holds  the  k  24-bit  cluster  centers  and  is  used  to
map  each  pixel  value  to  its  24-bit  cluster  center  when  the  photo  is
decompressed.

colors. (a) The original photo has 350,000 pixels (700 × 500), each a 24-bit RGB (red/blue/green)
triple of 8-bit values; these pixels (colors) are the “points” to be clustered. Points repeat, so there
are  only  79,083  distinct  colors  (less  than  224).  After  compression,  only  k  distinct  colors  are
used,  so  each  pixel  is  represented  by  only  ⌈1g  k⌉  bits  instead  of  24.  A  “palette”  maps  these
values back to 24-bit RGB values (the cluster centers). (b)–(e) The same photo with k = 4, 16,

including  game  playing

This  section  considers  problems  that  require  you  to  make  a  series  of
decisions. After each decision you receive feedback as to whether your
decision was correct. We will study a class of algorithms that are called
multiplicative-weights  algorithms.  This  class  of  algorithms  has  a  wide
in  economics,
variety  of  applications,
approximately  solving  linear-programming  and  multicommodity-ﬂow
problems,  and  various  applications  in  online  machine  learning.  We
emphasize  the  online  nature  of  the  problem  here:  you  have  to  make  a
sequence of decisions, but some of the information needed to make the
ith  decision  appears  only  after  you  have  already  made  the  (i  –  1)st
decision.  In  this  section,  we  look  at  one  particular  problem,  known  as
“learning  from  experts,”  and  develop  an  example  of  a  multiplicative-
weights algorithm, called the weighted-majority algorithm.

Suppose  that  a  series  of  events  will  occur,  and  you  want  to  make
predictions  about  these  events.  For  example,  over  a  series  of  days,  you
want  to  predict  whether  it  is  going  to  rain.  Or  perhaps  you  want  to
predict whether the price of a stock will increase or decrease. One way
to  approach  this  problem  is  to  assemble  a  group  of  “experts”  and  use
their collective wisdom in order to make good predictions. Let’s denote
the experts, n of them, by E1, E2, …, En, and let’s say that T events are
going  to  take  place.  Each  event  has  an  outcome  of  either  0  or  1,  with
o(t) denoting the outcome of the tth event. Before event t, each expert
E(i) makes a prediction
. You, as the “learner,” then take the
set  of  n  expert  predictions  for  event  t  and  produce  a  single  prediction
p(t)  ∈  {0,  1}  of  your  own.  You  base  your  prediction  only  on  the
predictions  of  the  experts  and  anything  you  have  learned  about  the
experts from their previous predictions. You do not use any additional
information about the event. Only after making your prediction do you
ascertain  the  outcome  o(t)  of  event  t.  If  your  prediction  p(t)  matches
o(t), then you were correct; otherwise, you made a mistake. The goal is
.
to  minimize  the  total  number  m  of  mistakes,  where

You can also keep track of the number of mistakes each expert makes:
expert Ei makes mi mistakes, where

.

For  example,  suppose  that  you  are  following  the  price  of  a  stock,
and  each  day  you  decide  whether  to  invest  in  it  for  just  that  day  by
buying it at the beginning of the day and selling it at the end of the day.
If,  on  some  day,  you  buy  the  stock  and  it  goes  up,  then  you  made  the
correct decision, but if the stock goes down, then you made a mistake.
Similarly, if on some day, you do not buy the stock and it goes down,
then you made the correct decision, but if the stock goes up, then you
made  a  mistake.  Since  you  would  like  to  make  as  few  mistakes  as
possible, you use the advice of the experts to make your decisions.

We’ll  assume  nothing  about  the  movement  of  the  stock.  We’ll  also
assume  nothing  about  the  experts:  the  experts’  predictions  could  be
correlated,  they  could  be  chosen  to  deceive  you,  or  perhaps  some  are
not really experts after all. What algorithm would you use?

Before designing an algorithm for this problem, we need to consider
what is a fair way to evaluate our algorithm. It is reasonable to expect
that  our  algorithm  performs  better  when  the  expert  predictions  are
better, and that it performs worse when the expert predictions are worse.
The goal of the algorithm is to limit the number of mistakes you make
to be close to the number of mistakes that the best of the experts makes.
At ﬁrst, this goal might seem impossible, because you do not know until
the  end  which  expert  is  best.  We’ll  see,  however,  that  by  taking  the
advice  provided  by  all  the  experts  into  account,  you  can  achieve  this
goal. More formally, we use the notion of “regret,” which compares our
algorithm to the performance of the best expert (in hindsight) over all.
Letting m* = min {mi : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} denote the number of mistakes made
by  the  best  expert,  the  regret  is  m  –  m*.  The  goal  is  to  design  an
algorithm with low regret. (Regret can be negative, although it typically
isn’t, since it is rare that you do better than the best expert.)

As  a  warm-up,  let’s  consider  the  case  in  which  one  of  the  experts
makes a correct prediction each time. Even without knowing who that
expert is, you can still achieve good results.

Lemma 33.3

Suppose  that  out  of  n  experts,  there  is  one  who  always  makes  the
correct  prediction  for  all  T  events.  Then  there  is  an  algorithm  that
makes at most ⌈1g n⌉ mistakes.

Proof   The algorithm maintains a set S consisting of experts who have
not  yet  made  a  mistake.  Initially,  S  contains  all  n  experts.  The
algorithm’s prediction is always the majority vote of the predictions of
the experts remaining in set S. In case of a tie, the algorithm makes any
prediction. After each outcome is learned, set S is updated to remove all
the experts who made an incorrect prediction about that outcome.

We  now  analyze  the  algorithm.  The  expert  who  always  makes  the
correct  prediction  will  always  be  in  set  S.  Every  time  the  algorithm
makes  a  mistake,  at  least  half  of  the  experts  who  were  still  in  S  also
make a mistake, and these experts are removed from S. If S′ is the set of
experts  remaining  after  removing  those  who  made  a  mistake,  we  have
that |S′| ≤ |S|/2. The size of S can be halved at most ⌈1g n⌉ times until |S|
=  1.  From  this  point  on,  we  know  that  the  algorithm  never  makes  a
mistake, since the set S consists only of the one expert who never makes
a  mistake.  Therefore,  overall  the  algorithm  makes  at  most  ⌈1g  n⌉
mistakes.

▪
Exercise  33.2-1  asks  you  to  generalize  this  result  to  the  case  when
there is no expert who makes perfect predictions and show that, for any
set  of  experts,  there  is  an  algorithm  that  makes  at  most  m*  ⌈1g  n⌉
mistakes. The generalized algorithm begins in the same way. The set S
might become empty at some point, however. If that ever happens, reset
S to contain all the experts and continue the algorithm.

You  can  substantially  improve  your  prediction  ability  by  not  just
tracking  which  experts  have  not  made  any  mistakes,  or  have  not  made
any  mistakes  recently,  to  a  more  nuanced  evaluation  of  the  quality  of
each  expert.  The  key  idea  is  to  use  the  feedback  you  receive  to  update
your evaluation of how much trust to put in each expert. As the experts
make  predictions,  you  observe  whether  they  were  correct  and  decrease
your  conﬁdence  in  the  experts  who  make  more  mistakes.  In  this  way,
you can learn over time which experts are more reliable and which are

less  reliable,  and  weight  their  predictions  accordlingly.  The  change  in
weights

is  accomplished  via  multiplication,  hence
“multiplicative weights.”

The algorithm appears in the procedure WEIGHTED-MAJORITY

the main for loop of lines 3–18 does the following for an event t = 1, 2,
…, T. Each expert Ei makes a prediction for event t in line 4. Lines 5–8
compute upweight(t), the sum of the weights of the experts who predict
1 for event t, and downweight(t), the sum of the weights of the experts
who predict 0 for the event. Lines 9–11 decide the algorithm’s prediction
p(t) for event t based on whichever weighted sum is larger (breaking ties
in  favor  of  deciding  1).  The  outcome  of  event  t  is  revealed  in  line  12.
Finally,  lines  14–17  decrease  the  weights  of  the  experts  who  made  an
incorrect  prediction  for  event  t  by  multiplying  their  weights  by  1  –  γ,
leaving  alone  the  weights  of  the  experts  who  correctly  predicted  the
event’s outcome. Thus, the fewer mistakes each expert makes, the higher
that expert’s weight.

The  WEIGHTED-MAJORITY  procedure  doesn’t  do  much  worse
than  any  expert.  In  particular,  it  doesn’t  do  much  worse  than  the  best
expert. To quantify this claim, let m(t) be the number of mistakes made
 be the number of mistakes
by the procedure through event t, and let
made by expert Ei through event t. The following theorem is the key.

Theorem 33.4
When running WEIGHTED-MAJORITY, we have, for every expert Ei
and every event T′ ≤ T,

Proof      Every  time  an  expert  Ei  makes  a  mistake,  its  weight,  which  is
initially 1, is multiplied by 1 – γ, and so we have

for t = 1, 2, …, T.

We use a potential function

, summing the weights for
all n experts after iteration t of the for loop of lines 3–18. Initially, we
have  W(0)  =  n  since  all  n  weights  start  out  with  the  value  1.  Because
each  expert  belongs  to  either  the  set  U  or  the  set  D  (deﬁned  in  lines  5

and  7  of  WEIGHTED-MAJORITY),  we  always  have  W(t)  =
upweight(t) + downweight(t) after each execution of line 8.

Consider an iteration t in which the algorithm makes a mistake in its
prediction,  which  means  that  either  the  algorithm  predicts  1  and  the
outcome is 0 or the algorithm predicts 0 and the outcome is 1. Without
loss of generality, assume that the algorithm predicts 1 and the outcome
is  0.  The  algorithm  predicted  1  because  upweight(t)  ≥  downweight(t)  in
line 9, which implies that

Each expert in U then has its weight multiplied by 1 – γ, and each expert
in D has its weight unchanged. Thus, we have

Therefore, for every iteration t in which the algorithm makes a mistake,
we have

In  an  iteration  where  the  algorithm  does  not  make  a  mistake,  some  of
the weights decrease and some remain unchanged, so that we have

Since there are m(T′) mistakes made through iteration T′, and W(1) = n,
we  can  repeatedly  apply  inequality  (33.8)  to  iterations  where  the
algorithm makes a mistake and inequality (33.9) to iterations where the
algorithm does not make a mistake, obtaining

Because  the  function  W  is  the  sum  of  the  weights  and  all  weights  are
positive,  its  value  exceeds  any  single  weight.  Therefore,  using  equation

(33.6) we have, for any expert Ei and for any iteration T′ ≤ T,

Combining inequalities (33.10) and (33.11) gives

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields

We  now  use  the  Taylor  series  expansion  to  derive  upper  and  lower
bounds  on  the  logarithmic  factors  in  inequality  (33.12).  The  Taylor
series for ln(1+x) is given in equation (3.22) on page 67. Substituting −x
for x, we have that for 0 < x ≤ 1/2,

Since each term on the right-hand side is negative, we can drop all terms
except the ﬁrst and obtain an upper bound of ln(1 – x) ≤ −x. Since 0 < γ
≤ 1/2, we have

For the lower bound, Exercise 33.2-2 asks you to show that ln(1 – x) ≥
−x − x2 when 0 < x ≤ 1/2, so that

Thus, we have

so that

Subtracting  ln  n  from  both  sides  of  inequality  (33.16)  and  then
,  thus
multiplying  both  sides  by  −2/γ  yields

proving the theorem.

Theorem  33.4  applies  to  any  expert  and  any  event  T′  ≤  T.  In
particular, we can compare against the best expert after all events have
occurred, producing the following corollary.

Corollary 33.5
At the end of procedure WEIGHTED-MAJORITY, we have

▪

Let’s  explore  this  bound.  Assuming  that

,  we  can

choose

 and plug into inequality (33.17) to obtain

▪

and so the number of errors is at most twice the number of errors made
by  the  best  expert  plus  a  term  that  is  often  slower  growing  than  m*.
Exercise 33.2-4 shows that you can decrease the bound on the number
of errors by a factor of 2 by using randomization, which leads to much
stronger  bounds.  In  particular,  the  upper  bound  on  regret  (m  –  m*)  is
reduced from (1 + 2γ)m* + (2 ln n)/γ to an expected value of ϵm* + (ln
n)/ϵ, where both γ and ϵ are at most 1/2. Numerically, we can see that
ifγ = 1/2, WEIGHTED-MAJORITY makes at most 3 times the number
of  errors  as  the  best  expert,  plus  4  ln  n  errors.  As  another  example,
suppose  that  T  =  1000  predictions  are  being  made  by  n  =  20  experts,
and the best expert is correct 95% of the time, making 50 errors. Then
WEIGHTED-MAJORITY  makes  at  most  100(1+γ)+2  ln  20/γ  errors.
By  choosing  γ  =  1/4,  WEIGHTED-MAJORITY  makes  at  most  149
errors, or a success rate of at least 85%.

Multiplicative  weights  methods  typically  refer  to  a  broader  class  of
algorithms that includes WEIGHTED-MAJORITY. The outcomes and
predictions need not be only 0 or 1, but can be real numbers, and there
can be a loss associated with a particular outcome and prediction. The
weights  can  be  updated  by  a  multiplicative  factor  that  depends  on  the
loss,  and  the  algorithm  can,  given  a  set  of  weights,  treat  them  as  a
distribution  on  experts  and  use  them  to  choose  an  expert  to  follow  in
each  event.  Even  in  these  more  general  settings,  bounds  similar  to
Theorem 33.4 hold.

Consider  a  randomized  version  of  WEIGHTED-MAJORITY.  The
algorithm  is  the  same,  except  for  the  prediction  step,  which  interprets

the weights as a probability distribution over the experts and chooses an
expert Ei according to that distribution. It then chooses its prediction to
be the same as the prediction made by expert Ei. Show that, for any 0 <
ϵ < 1/2, the expected number of mistakes made by this algorithm is at
most (1 + ϵ)m* + (ln n)/ϵ.

33.3    Gradient descent

Suppose that you have a set {p1, p2, …, pn} of points and you want to
ﬁnd the line that best ﬁts these points. For any line ℓ, there is a distance
di  between  each  point  pi  and  the  line.  You  want  to  ﬁnd  the  line  that
minimizes some function f(d1, …, dn). There are many possible choices
for  the  deﬁnition  of  distance  and  for  the  function  f.  For  example,  the
distance can be the projection distance to the line and the function can
be  the  sum  of  the  squares  of  the  distances.  This  type  of  problem  is
common  in  data  science  and  machine  learning—the  line  is  the
hypothesis that best describes the data—where the particular deﬁnition
of best is determined by the deﬁnition of distance and the objective f. If
the deﬁnition of distance and the function f are linear, then we have a
linear-programming problem, as discussed in Chapter 29. Although the
linear-programming  framework  captures  several  important  problems,
many  other  problems,  including  various  machine-learning  problems,
have objectives and constraints that are not necessarily linear. We need
frameworks and algorithms to solve such problems.

In this section, we consider the problem of optimizing a continuous
function  and  discuss  one  of  the  most  popular  methods  to  do  so:
gradient  descent.  Gradient  descent  is  a  general  method  for  ﬁnding  a
n  →  ℝ,  where  informally,  a  local
local  minimum  of  a  function  f  :  ℝ
minimum of a function f is a point x for which f(x) ≤ f(x′) for all x′ that
are “near” x. When the function is convex, it can ﬁnd a point near the
global  minimizer  of  f:  an  n-vector  argument  x  =  (x1,  x2,  …,  xn)  such
that  f(x)  is  minimum.  For  the  intuitive  idea  behind  gradient  descent,
imagine being in a landscape of hills and valleys, and wanting to get to

a low point as quickly as possible. You survey the terrain and choose to
move  in  the  direction  that  takes  you  downhill  the  fastest  from  your
current position. You move in that direction, but only for a short while,
because  as  you  proceed,  the  terrain  changes  and  you  might  need  to
choose  a  different  direction.  So  you  stop,  reevaluate  the  possible
directions  and  move  another  short  distance  in  the  steepest  downhill
direction,  which  might  differ  from  the  direction  of  your  previous
movement.  You  continue  this  process  until  you  reach  a  point  from
which all directions lead up. Such a point is a local minimum.

n → ℝ

In  order  to  make  this  informal  procedure  more  formal,  we  need  to
deﬁne  the  gradient  of  a  function,  which  in  the  analogy  above  is  a
measure of the steepness of the various directions. Given a function f :
n comprising n partial
n → ℝ, its gradient ∇f is a function ∇f : ℝ
ℝ
.  Analogous  to  the  derivative  of  a
derivatives:
function of a single variable, the gradient can be viewed as a direction in
which  the  function  value  locally  increases  the  fastest,  and  the  rate  of
that increase. This view is informal; in order to make it formal we would
have  to  deﬁne  what  local  means  and  place  certain  conditions,  such  as
continuity or existence of derivatives, on the function. Nevertheless, this
view motivates the key step of gradient descent—move in the direction
opposite to the gradient, by a distance inﬂuenced by the magnitude of
the gradient.

The  general  procedure  of  gradient  descent  proceeds  in  steps.  You
start at some initial point x(0), which is an n-vector. At each step t, you
compute the value of the gradient of f at point x(t), that is, (∇f)(x(t)),
which is also an n-vector. You then move in the direction opposite to the
gradient  in  each  dimension  at  x(t)  to  arrive  at  the  next  point  x(t+1),
which  again  is  an  n-vector.  Because  you  moved  in  a  monotonically
decreasing direction in each dimension, you should have that f(x(t+1)) ≤
f(x(t)).  Several  details  are  needed  to  turn  this  idea  into  an  actual
algorithm. The two main details are that you need an initial point and
that you need to decide how far to move in the direction of the negative
gradient. You also need to understand when to stop and what you can

conclude about the quality of the solution found. We will explore these
issues further in this section, for both constrained minimization, where
there  are  additional  constraints  on  the  points,  and  unconstrained
minimization, where there are none.

Unconstrained gradient descent

In order to gain intuition, let’s consider unconstrained gradient descent
in just one dimension, that is, when f is a function of a scalar x, so that f
: ℝ → ℝ. In this case, the gradient ∇f of f is just f′(x), the derivative of f
with respect to x. Consider the function f shown in blue in Figure 33.3,
with  minimizer  x*  and  starting  point  x(0).  The  gradient  (derivative)  f′
(x(0)), shown in orange, has a negative slope, so that a small step from
x(0) in the direction of increasing x results in a point x′ for which f(x′) <
f(x(0)). Too large a step, however, results in a

Figure  33.3  A  function  f  :  ℝ  →  ℝ,  shown  in  blue.  Its  gradient  at  point  x(0),  in  orange,  has  a
negative  slope,  and  so  a  small  increase  in  x  from  x(0)  to  x′  results  in  f(x′)  <  f(x(0)).  Small
increases in x from x(0) head toward
, which gives a local minimum. Too large an increase in x
can  end  up  at  x″,  where  f(x″)  >  f(x(0)).  Small  steps  starting  from  x(0)  and  going  only  in  the
direction of decreasing values of f cannot end up at the global minimizer x*.

point  x″  for  which  f(x″)  >  f(x(0)),  so  this  is  a  bad  idea.  Restricting
ourselves  to  small  steps,  where  each  one  has  f(x′)  <  f(x),  eventually
,  which  gives  a  local  minimum.  By
results  in  getting  close  to  point

taking  only  small  downhill  steps,  however,  gradient  descent  has  no
chance to get to the global minimizer x*, given the starting point x(0).

We draw two observations from this simple example. First, gradient
descent converges toward a local minimum, and not necessarily a global
minimum. Second, the speed at which it converges and how it behaves
are related to properties of the function, to the initial point, and to the
step size of the algorithm.

The procedure GRADIENT-DESCENT on the facing page takes as
input a function f, an initial point x(0) ∈ ℝ
n, a ﬁxed step-size multiplier
γ  >  0,  and  a  number  T  >  0  of  steps  to  take.  Each  iteration  of  the  for
loop  of  lines  2–4  performs  a  step  by  computing  the  n-dimensional
gradient  at  point  x(t)  and  then  moving  distance  γ  in  the  opposite
direction in the n-dimensional space. The complexity of computing the
gradient  depends  on  the  function  f  and  can  sometimes  be  expensive.
Line 3 sums the points visited. After the loop terminates, line 6 returns
x-avg, the average of all the points visited except for the last one, x(T).
It  might  seem  more  natural  to  return  x(T),  and  in  fact,  in  many
circumstances,  you  might  prefer  to  have  the  function  return  x(T).  For
the version we will analyze, however, we use x-avg.

// n-dimensional vector, initially all 0

GRADIENT-DESCENT(f, x(0), γ, T)
1 sum = 0
2 for t = 0 to T – 1

sum = sum + x(t)
// add each of n dimensions into sum
x(t+1) = x(t) – γ · (∇f)(x(t))// (∇f)(x(t)), x(t+1) are n-dimensional

// divide each of n dimensions by T

6 return x-avg

Figure 33.4 depicts how gradient descent ideally runs on a convex 1-
dimensional function.1 We’ll deﬁne convexity more formally below, but
the  ﬁgure  shows  that  each  iteration  moves  in  the  direction  opposite  to
the  gradient,  with  the  distance  moved  being  proportional  to  the

magnitude of the gradient. As the iterations proceed, the magnitude of
the  gradient  decreases,  and  thus  the  distance  moved  along  the
horizontal  axis  decreases.  After  each  iteration,  the  distance  to  the
optimal  point  x*  decreases.  This  ideal  behavior  is  not  guaranteed  to
occur  in  general,  but  the  analysis  in  the  remainder  of  this  section
formalizes  when  this  behavior  occurs  and  quantiﬁes  the  number  of
iterations needed. Gradient descent does not always work, however. We
have  already  seen  that  if  the  function  is  not  convex,  gradient  descent
can converge to a local, rather than global, minimum. We have also seen
that if the step size is too large, GRADIENT-DESCENT can overshoot
the minimum and wind up farther away. (It is also possible to overshoot
the minimum and wind up closer to the optimum.)

Analysis of unconstrained gradient descent for convex functions

Our analysis of gradient descent focuses on convex functions. Inequality
(C.29) on page 1194 deﬁnes a convex function of one variable, as shown
n → ℝ
in Figure 33.5. We can extend that deﬁnition to a function f : ℝ
n and for all 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, we have
and say that f is convex if for all x, y ∈ ℝ

(Inequalities (33.18) and (C.29) are the same, except for the dimensions
of x and y.) We also assume that our convex functions are closed2 and
differentiable.

Figure 33.4 An example of running gradient descent on a convex function f : ℝ → ℝ, shown in
blue. Beginning at point x(0), each iteration moves in the direction opposite to the gradient, and
the distance moved is proportional to the magnitude of the gradient. Orange lines represent the
negative of the gradient at each point, scaled by the step size γ. As the iterations proceed, the
magnitude of the gradient decreases, and the distance moved decreases correspondingly. After
each iteration, the distance to the optimal point x* decreases.

Figure 33.5 A convex function f : ℝ → ℝ, shown in blue, with local and global minimizer x*.
Because f is convex, f(λx + (1 – λ)y) ≤ λf(x) + (1 – λ)f(y) for any two values x and y and all 0 ≤ λ ≤
1, shown for a particular value of λ. Here, the orange line segment represents all values λf(x) +
(1 – λ)f(y) for 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, and it is above the blue line.

A convex function has the property that any local minimum is also a
global  minimum.  To  verify  this  property,  consider  inequality  (33.18),
and suppose for the purpose of contradiction that x is a local minimum
but not a global minimum and y ≠ x is a global minimum, so f(y) < f(x).
Then we have

f(λx + (1 – λ)y) ≤ λf(x) + (1 – λ)f(y) (by inequality (33.18))

< λf(x) + (1 – λ)f(x)
= f(x).

Thus, letting approach 1, we see that there is another point near x, say
x′, such that f(x′) < f(x), so x is not a local minimum.

Convex  functions  have  several  useful  properties.  The  ﬁrst  property,
whose  proof  we  leave  as  Exercise  33.3-1,  says  that  a  convex  function
always  lies  above  its  tangent  hyperplane.  In  the  context  of  gradient
descent, angle brackets denote the notation for inner product deﬁned on
page 1219 rather than denoting a sequence.

For any convex differentiable function f : ℝ
we have ≤ f(x) ≤ f(y) + 〈(∇f)(x), x – y〉.

The  second  property,  which  Exercise  33.3-2  asks  you  to  prove,  is  a
repeated application of the deﬁnition of convexity in inequality (33.18).

The left-hand side of inequality (33.19) is the value of f at the vector

x-avg that GRADIENT-DESCENT returns.

We  now  proceed  to  analyze  GRADIENT-DESCENT.  It  might  not
return the exact global minimizer x*. We use an error bound ϵ, and we
want to choose T so that f(x-avg) – f(x*) ≤ ϵ at termination. The value
of ϵ depends on the number T of iterations and two additional values.
First,  since  you  expect  it  to  be  better  to  start  close  to  the  global
minimizer, ϵ is a function of

the euclidean norm (or distance, deﬁned on page 1219) of the difference
between x(0) and x*. The error bound ϵ is also a function of a quantity
we call L, which is an upper bound on the magnitude ∥(∇f)(x)∥ of the
gradient, so that

where x ranges over all the points x(0), …, x(T–1) whose gradients are
computed  by  GRADIENT-DESCENT.  Of  course,  we  don’t  know  the
values  of  L  and  R,  but  for  now  let’s  assume  that  we  do.  We’ll  discuss
later  how  to  remove  these  assumptions.  The  analysis  of  GRADIENT-
DESCENT is summarized in the following theorem.

Theorem 33.8
n be the minimizer of a convex function f, and suppose that
Let x* ∈ ℝ
an  execution  of  GRADIENT-DESCENT(f,  x(0),  γ,  T)  returns  x-avg,
where
  and  R  and  L  are  deﬁned  in  equations  (33.20)  and
(33.21). Let

. Then we have f(x-avg) – f(x*) ≤ ϵ.

▪

We  now  prove  this  theorem.  We  do  not  give  an  absolute  bound  on
how  much  progress  each  iteration  makes.  Instead,  we  use  a  potential
function,  as  in  Section  16.3.  Here,  we  deﬁne  a  potential  Φ(t)  after
computing  x(t),  such  that  Φ(t)  ≥  0  for  t  =  0,  …,  T.  We  deﬁne  the
amortized progress in the iteration that computes x(t) as

Along with including the change in potential (Φ(t + 1) – Φ(t)), equation
(33.22) also subtracts the minimum value f(x*) because ultimately, you
care not about the values f(x(t)) but about how close they are to f(x*).
Suppose that we can show that p(t) ≤ B for some value B and t = 0, …,
T – 1. Then we can substitute for p(t) using equation (33.22), giving

Summing inequality (33.23) over t = 0, …, T – 1 yields

Observing that we have a telescoping series on the right and regrouping
terms, we have that

Dividing by T and dropping the positive term Φ(T) gives

and thus we have

In  other  words,  if  we  can  show  that  p(t)  ≤  B  for  some  value  B  and
choose a potential function where Φ(0) is not too large, then inequality
(33.25) tells us how close the function value f(x-avg) is to the function
value f(x*) after T iterations. That is, we can set the error bound ϵ to B
+ Φ(0)/T.

In order to bound the amortized progress, we need to come up with

a concrete potential function. Deﬁne the potential function Φ(t) by

that  is,  the  potential  function  is  proportional  to  the  square  of  the
distance  between  the  current  point  and  the  minimizer  x*.  With  this
potential  function  in  hand,  the  next  lemma  provides  a  bound  on  the
amortized progress made in any iteration of GRADIENT-DESCENT.

Lemma 33.9
n be the minimizer of a convex function f, and consider an
Let x* ∈ ℝ
execution  of  GRADIENT-DESCENT(f,  x(0),  γ,  T).  Then  for  each
point x(t) computed by the procedure, we have that

Proof   We ﬁrst bound the potential change Φ(t + 1) – Φ(t). Using the
deﬁnition of Φ(t) from equation (33.26), we have

From line 4 in GRADIENT-DESCENT, we know that

and  so  we  would  like  to  rewrite  equation  (33.27)  to  have  x(t+1)  –  x(t)
terms. As Exercise 33.3-3 asks you to prove, for any two vectors a, b ∈
ℝ

n, we have

Letting a = x(t) – x* and b = x(t+1) – x(t), we can write the right-hand
side  of  equation  (33.27)  as
.  Then  we  can  express  the
potential change as

and thus we have

We  can  now  proceed  to  bound  p(t).  By  the  bound  on  the  potential
change from inequality (33.31), and using the deﬁnition of L (inequality
(33.21)), we have

sult in the following theorem

▪

Having bounded the amortized progress in one step, we now analyze
the entire GRADIENT-DESCENT procedure, completing the proof of
Theorem 33.8.

Proof  of  Theorem  33.8  Inequality  (33.25)  tells  us  that  if  we  have  an
upper bound of B for p(t), then we also have the bound f(x-avg) – f(x*)
≤  B  +  Φ(0)/T.  By  equations  (33.20)  and  (33.26),  we  have  that  Φ(0)  =
R2/(2γ). Lemma 33.9 gives us the upper bound of B = γL2/2, and so we
have

Our  choice  of
the two terms, and we obtain

Since  we  chose

  in  the  theorem  statement,  the  proof  is

▪

Continuing  under  the  assumption  that  we  know  R  (from  equation
(33.20)) and L (from inequality (33.21)), we can think of the analysis in
a slightly different way. We can presume that we have a target accuracy
ϵ  and  then  compute  the  number  of  iterations  needed.  That  is,  we  can
2.  The  number  of
  for  T,  obtaining  T  =  R2L2/ϵ
solve
iterations  thus  depends  on  the  square  of  R  and  L  and,  most
2.  (The  deﬁnition  of  L  from  inequality  (33.21)
importantly,  on  1/ϵ
depends  on  T,  but  we  may  know  an  upper  bound  on  L  that  doesn’t
depend on the particular value of T.) Thus, if you want to halve your
error bound, you need to run four times as many iterations.

It  is  quite  possible  that  we  don’t  really  know  R  and  L,  since  you’d
need to know x* in order to know R (since R = ∥x(0) – x*∥), and you
might  not  have  an  explicit  upper  bound  on  the  gradient,  which  would
provide L. You can, however, interpret the analysis of gradient descent
as  a  proof  that  there  is  some  step  size  for  which  the  procedure  makes
progress  toward  the  minimum.  You  can  then  compute  a  step  size  for
which f(x(t)) – f(x(t+1)) is large enough. In fact, not having a ﬁxed step
size  multiplier  can  actually  help  in  practice,  as  you  are  free  to  use  any
step  size  s  that  achieves  sufﬁcient  decrease  in  the  value  of  f.  You  can
search for a step size that achieves a large decrease via a binary-search-
like routine, which is often called line search. For a given function f and
step size s, deﬁne the function g(x(t), s) = f(x(t)) – s(∇f)(x(t)). Start with
a small step size s for which g(x(t), s) ≤ f(x(t)). Then repeatedly double s

until  g(x(t),  2s)  ≥  g(x(t),  s),  and  then  perform  a  binary  search  in  the
interval  [s,  2s].  This  procedure  can  produce  a  step  size  that  achieves  a
signiﬁcant  decrease  in  the  objective  function.  In  other  circumstances,
however, you may know good upper bounds on R and L, typically from
problem-speciﬁc information, which can sufﬁce.

The  dominant  computational  step  in  each  iteration  of  the  for  loop
of  lines  2–4  is  computing  the  gradient.  The  complexity  of  computing
and evaluating a gradient varies widely, depending on the application at
hand. We’ll discuss several applications later.

Constrained gradient descent

We  can  adapt  gradient  descent  for  constrained  minimization  to
minimize  a  closed  convex  function  f(x),  subject  to  the  additional
requirement that x ∈ K, where K is a closed convex body. A body K ⊆
n is convex if for all x, y ∈ K, the convex combination λx+(1–λ)y ∈ K
ℝ
for  all  0  ≤  λ  ≤  1.  A  closed  convex  body  contains  its  limit  points.
Somewhat surprisingly, restricting to the constrained problem does not
signiﬁcantly increase the number of iterations of gradient descent. The
idea  is  that  you  run  the  same  algorithm,  but  in  each  iteration,  check
whether the current point x(t) is still within the convex body K. If it is
not, just move to the closest point in K. Moving to the closest point is
known as projection. We formally deﬁne the projection ∏K(x) of a point
x in n dimensions onto a convex body K as the point y ∈ K such that ∥x
– y∥ = min {∥x – z∥ : z ∈ K}. If we have x ∈ K, then ∏K(x) = x.

This  one  change  yields  the  procedure  GRADIENT-DESCENT-
CONSTRAINED,  in  which  line  4  of  GRADIENT-DESCENT  is
replaced by two lines. It assumes that x(0) ∈ K. Line 4 of GRADIENT-
DESCENT-CONSTRAINED  moves  in  the  direction  of  the  negative
gradient, and line 5 projects back onto K. The lemma that follows helps
to show that when x* ∈ K, if the projection step in line 5 moves from a
point outside of K to a point in K, it cannot be moving away from x*.

derive an upper bound that matches inequality (33.31). We continue to
deﬁne Φ(t) as in equation (33.26), but noting that x(t+1), computed in
line  5  of  GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED,  has  a  different
meaning here from in inequality (33.31):

(t+1)–x*∥

With the same upper bound on the change in the potential function as
in  equation  (33.30),  the  entire  proof  of  Lemma  33.9  can  proceed  as
before.  We  can  therefore  conclude  that  the  procedure  GRADIENT-

DESCENT-CONSTRAINED  has  the  same  asymptotic  complexity  as
GRADIENT-DESCENT.  We  summarize  this  result  in  the  following
theorem.

Applications of gradient descent

Gradient descent has many applications to minimizing functions and is
widely used in optimization and machine learning. Here we sketch how
it can be used to solve linear systems. Then we discuss an application to
machine learning: prediction using linear regression.

In  Chapter  28,  we  saw  how  to  use  Gaussian  elimination  to  solve  a
system of linear equations Ax = b, thereby computing x = A−1b. If A is
an  n  ×  n  matrix  and  b  is  a  length-n  vector,  then  the  running  time  of
Gaussian  elimination  is  Θ(n3),  which  for  large  matrices  might  be
prohibitively  expensive.  If  an  approximate  solution  is  acceptable,
however, you can use gradient descent.

First,  let’s  see  how  to  use  gradient  descent  as  a  roundabout—and
admittedly inefﬁcient—way to solve for x in the scalar equation ax = b,
where a, x, b ∈ ℝ. This equation is equivalent to ax – b = 0. If ax – b is
the derivative of a convex function f(x), then ax – b = 0 for the value of
x  that  minimizes  f(x).  Given  f(x),  gradient  descent  can  then  determine
this  minimizer.  Of  course,  f(x)  is  just  the  integral  of  ax  –  b,  that  is,
, which is convex if a ≥ 0. Therefore, one way to solve ax

= b for a ≥ 0 is to ﬁnd the minimizer for

 via gradient descent.

We  now  generalize  this  idea  to  higher  dimensions,  where  using
gradient  descent  may  actually  lead  to  a  faster  algorithm.  One  n-

, where A is an n ×
dimensional analog is the function
n matrix. The gradient of f with respect to x is the function Ax – b. To
ﬁnd  the  value  of  x  that  minimizes  f,  we  set  the  gradient  of  f  to  0  and
solve  for  x.  Solving  Ax–b  =  0  for  x,  we  obtain  x  =  A−1b,  Thus,
minimizing f(x) is equivalent to solving Ax = b. If f(x) is convex, then
gradient descent can approximately compute this minimum.

A  1-dimensional  function  is  convex  when  its  second  derivative  is
positive.  The  equivalent  deﬁnition  for  a  multidimensional  function  is
that  it  is  convex  when  its  Hessian  matrix  is  positive-semideﬁnite  (see
2f)(x)  of  a
page  1222  for  a  deﬁnition),  where  the  Hessian  matrix  (∇
function f(x) is the matrix in which entry (i, j) is the partial derivative of
f with respect to i and j:

Analogous to the 1-dimensional case, the Hessian of f is just A, and so
if A is a positive-semideﬁnite matrix, then we can use gradient descent
to ﬁnd a point x where Ax ≈ b. If R and L are not too large, then this
method is faster than using Gaussian elimination.

Gradient descent in machine learning

As  a  concrete  example  of  supervised  learning  for  prediction,  suppose
that  you  want  to  predict  whether  a  patient  will  develop  heart  disease.
For each of m patients, you have n different attributes. For example, you
might  have  n  =  4  and  the  four  pieces  of  data  are  age,  height,  blood
pressure,  and  number  of  close  family  members  with  heart  disease.
Denote the data for patient i as a vector x(i) ∈ ℝ
 giving the
jth entry in vector x(i). The label of patient i is denoted by a scalar y(i)
∈  ℝ,  signifying  the  severity  of  the  patient’s  heart  disease.  The
hypothesis  should  capture  a  relationship  between  the  x(i)  values  and

n, with

y(i).  For  this  example,  we  make  the  modeling  assumption  that  the
relationship  is  linear,  and  therefore  the  goal  is  to  compute  the  “best”
linear relationship between the x(i) values and y(i): a linear function f :
n  →  ℝ  such  that  f(x(i))  ≈  y(i)  for  each  patient  i.  Of  course,  no  such
ℝ
function  may  exist,  but  you  would  like  one  that  comes  as  close  as
possible. A linear function f can be deﬁned by a vector of weights w =
(w0, w1, …, wn), with

When  evaluating  a  machine-learning  model,  you  need  to  measure
how  close  each  value  f(x(i))  is  to  its  corresponding  label  y(i).  In  this
example, we deﬁne the error e(i) ∈ ℝ associated with patient i as e(i) =
f(x(i)) – y(i). The objective function we choose is to minimize the sum of
squares of the errors, which is

The  objective  function  is  typically  called  the  loss  function,  and  the
least-squares  error  given  by  equation  (33.33)  is  just  one  example  of
many  possible  loss  functions.  The  goal  is  then,  given  the  x(i)  and  y(i)
values, to compute the weights w0, w1, …, wn so as to minimize the loss
function in equation (33.33). The variables here are the weights w0, w1,
…, wn and not the x(i) or y(i) values.

This  particular  objective  is  sometimes  known  as  a  least-squares  ﬁt,
and  the  problem  of  ﬁnding  a  linear  function  to  ﬁt  data  and  minimize
the least-squares error is called linear regression. Finding a least-squares
ﬁt is also addressed in Section 28.3.

When  the  function  f  is  linear,  the  loss  function  deﬁned  in  equation
(33.33)  is  convex,  because  it  is  the  sum  of  squares  of  linear  functions,
which are themselves convex. Therefore, we can apply gradient descent
to compute a set of weights to approximately minimize the least-squares
error. The concrete goal of learning is to be able to make predictions on
new  data.  Informally,  if  the  features  are  all  reported  in  the  same  units
and are from the same range (perhaps from being normalized), then the
weights tend to have a natural interpretation because the features of the
data  that  are  better  predictors  of  the  label  have  a  larger  associated
weight.  For  example,  you  would  expect  that,  after  normalization,  the
weight  associated  with  the  number  of  family  members  with  heart
disease would be larger than the weight associated with height.

The  computed  weights  form  a  model  of  the  data.  Once  you  have  a
model,  you  can  make  predictions,  so  that  given  new  data,  you  can
predict its label. In our example, given a new patient x′ who is not part
of  the  original  training  data  set,  you  would  still  hope  to  predict  the
chance  that  the  new  patient  develops  heart  disease.  You  can  do  so  by
computing  the  label  f(x′),  incorporating  the  weights  computed  by
gradient descent.

For  this  linear-regression  problem,  the  objective  is  to  minimize  the
expression in equation (33.33), which is a quadratic in each of the n+1
weights wj. Thus, entry j in the gradient is linear in wj. Exercise 33.3-5
asks  you  to  explicitly  compute  the  gradient  and  see  that  it  can  be
computed  in  O(nm)  time,  which  is  linear  in  the  input  size.  Compared
with the exact method of solving equation (33.33) in Chapter 28, which
needs to invert a matrix, gradient descent is typically much faster.

Section  33.1  brieﬂy  discussed  regularization—the  idea  that  a
complicated hypothesis should be penalized in order to avoid overﬁtting
the  training  data.  Regularization  often  involves  adding  a  term  to  the
objective  function,  but  it  can  also  be  achieved  by  adding  a  constraint.
One way to regularize this example would be to explicitly limit the norm
of the weights, adding a constraint that ∥w∥ ≤ B for some bound B > 0.
(Recall  again  that  the  components  of  the  vector  w  are  the  variables  in
the present application.) Adding this constraint controls the complexity

of  the  model,  as  the  number  of  values  wj  that  can  have  large  absolute
value is now limited.

In order to run GRADIENT-DESCENT-CONSTRAINED for any
problem,  you  need  to  implement  the  projection  step,  as  well  as  to
compute  bounds  on  R  and  L.  We  conclude  this  section  by  describing
these  calculations  for  gradient  descent  with  the  constraint  ∥w∥  ≤  B.
First, consider the projection step in line 5. Suppose that the update in
line  4  results  in  a  vector  w′.  The  projection  is  implemented  by
computing  ∏k(w′)  where  K  is  deﬁned  by  ∥w∥  ≤  B.  This  particular
projection can be accomplished by simply scaling w′, since we know that
closest point in K to w′ must be the point along the vector whose norm
is  exactly  B.  The  amount  z  by  which  we  need  to  scale  w′  to  hit  the
boundary  of  K  is  the  solution  to  the  equation  z  ∥w′∥  =  B,  which  is
solved  by  z  =  B/∥w′∥.  Hence  line  5  is  implemented  by  computing  w  =
w′B/∥w′∥. Because we always have ∥w∥ ≤ B, Exercise 33.3-6 asks you to
show that the upper bound on the magnitude L of the gradient is O(B).
We  also  get  a  bound  on  R,  as  follows.  By  the  constraint  ∥w∥  ≤  B,  we
∥ ≤ B and ∥w*∥ ≤ B, and thus ∥w(0) – w*∥ ≤ 2B.
know that both ∥w(0)
Using  the  deﬁnition  of  R  in  equation  (33.20),  we  have  R  =  O(B).  The
bound
  on  the  accuracy  of  the  solution  after  T  iterations  in
Theorem 33.11 becomes

minimum)  of  a  function.  Another  algorithm  in  this  spirit  is  known  as
Newton’s method, which is an iterative algorithm that ﬁnds the root of a
function. Here, we consider Newton’s method which, given a function f :
ℝ  →  ℝ,  ﬁnds  a  value  x*  such  that  f(x*  )  =  0.  The  algorithm  moves
through a series of points x(0), x(1), …. If the algorithm is currently at
a point x(t), then to ﬁnd point x(t+1), it ﬁrst takes the equation of the
line tangent to the curve at x = x(t),
y = f′(x(t))(x – x(t)) + f(x(t)).
It then uses the x-intercept of this line as the next point x(t+1).

a. Show that the algorithm described above can be summarized by the

update rule

We restrict our attention to some domain I and assume that f′(x) ≠ 0 for
all x ∈ I and that f″(x) is continuous. We also assume that the starting
point  x(0)  is  sufﬁciently  close  to  x*,  where  “sufﬁciently  close”  means
that we can use only the ﬁrst two terms of the Taylor expansion of f(x*)
about x(0), namely

(0) is some value between x(0) and x*. If the approximation in

where γ
equation (33.34) holds for x(0), it also holds for any point closer to x*.

b. Assume that the function f has exactly one point x* for which f(x*) =

(t) = |x(t) – x*|. Using the Taylor expansion in equation

0. Let ϵ
(33.34), show that

where γ

(t) is some value between x(t) and x*.

c. If

(0) < 1, then we say that the function f has
for some constant c and ϵ
quadratic  convergence,  since  the  error  decreases  quadratically.
Assuming  that  f  has  quadratic  convergence,  how  many  iterations  are
needed to ﬁnd a root of f(x) to an accuracy of δ? Your answer should
include δ.

d. Suppose you wish to ﬁnd a root of the function f(x) = (x – 3)2, which

is also the minimizer, and you start at x(0) = 3.5. Compare the
number of iterations needed by gradient descent to ﬁnd the minimizer
and Newton’s method to ﬁnd the root.

33-2     Hedge
Another  variant  in  the  multiplicative-weights  framework  is  known  as
HEDGE. It differs from WEIGHTED MAJORITY in two ways. First,
HEDGE  makes  the  prediction  randomly—in  iteration  t,  it  assigns  a
probability
.  It  then
  to  expert  Ei,  where
chooses  an  expert  Ei′  according  to  this  probability  distribution  and
predicts  according  to  Ei′.  Second,  the  update  rule  is  different.  If  an
expert makes a mistake, line 16 updates that expert’s weight by the rule
, for some 0 < ϵ < 1. Show that the expected number of
mistakes made by HEDGE, running for T rounds, is at most m* + (ln
n)/ϵ + ϵT.

33-3     Nonoptimality of Lloyd’s procedure in one dimension

Give an example to show that even in one dimension, Lloyd’s procedure
for  ﬁnding  clusters  does  not  always  return  an  optimum  result.  That  is,
Lloyd’s  procedure  may  terminate  and  return  as  a  result  a  set  C  of
clusters that does not minimize f(S, C), even when S is a set of points
on a line.

33-4     Stochastic gradient descent
Consider the problem described in Section 33.3 of ﬁtting a line f(x) = ax
+  b  to  a  given  set  of  point/value  pairs  S  =  {(x1,  y1),  …,  (xT,  yT)}  by
optimizing the choice of the parameters a and b using gradient descent
to  ﬁnd  a  best  least-squares  ﬁt.  Here  we  consider  the  case  where  x  is  a
real-valued variable, rather than a vector.

Suppose that you are not given the point/value pairs in S all at once,
but only one at a time in an online manner. Furthermore, the points are
given in random order. That is, you know that there are n points, but in

iteration  t  you  are  given  only  (xi,  yi)  where  i  is  independently  and
randomly chosen from {1, …, T}.

You can use gradient descent to compute an estimate to the function.
As  each  point  (xi,  yi)  is  considered,  you  can  update  the  current  values
of a and b by taking the derivative with respect to a and b of the term
of  the  objective  function  depending  on  (xi,  yi).  Doing  so  gives  you  a
stochastic estimate of the gradient, and you can then take a small step
in the opposite direction.

Give pseudcode to implement this variant of gradient descent. What
would the expected value of the error be as a function of T, L, and R?
(Hint:  Replicate  the  analysis  of  GRADIENT-DESCENT  in  Section
33.3 for this variant.)

This  procedure  and  its  variants  are  known  as  stochastic  gradient

descent.

Chapter notes

For  a  general  introduction  to  artiﬁcial  intelligence,  we  recommend
Russell  and  Norvig  [391].  For  a  general  introduction  to  machine
learning, we recommend Murphy [340].

Lloyd’s  procedure  for  the  k-means  problem  was  ﬁrst  proposed  by
Lloyd [304] and also later by Forgy [151]. It is sometimes called “Lloyd’s
algorithm”  or  the  “Lloyd-Forgy  algorithm.”  Although  Mahajan  et  al.
[310] showed that ﬁnding an optimal clustering is NP-hard, even in the
plane, Kanungo et al. [241] have shown that there is an approximation
algorithm for the k-means problem with approximation ratio 9 + ϵ, for
any ϵ > 0.

The multiplicative-weights method is surveyed by Arora, Hazan, and
Kale  [25].  The  main  idea  of  updating  weights  based  on  feedback  has
been  rediscovered  many  times.  One  early  use  is  in  game  theory,  where
Brown deﬁned “Fictitious Play” [74] and conjectured its convergence to
the  value  of  a  zero-sum  game.  The  convergence  properties  were
established by Robinson [382].

In  machine  learning,  the  ﬁrst  use  of  multiplicative  weights  was  by
Littlestone in the Winnow algorithm [300], which was later extended by
Littlestone and Warmuth to the weighted-majority algorithm described
in  Section  33.2  [301].  This  work  is  closely  connected  to  the  boosting
algorithm,  originally  due
[159].  The
multiplicative-weights idea is also closely related to several more general
optimization  algorithms,  including  the  perceptron  algorithm  [328]  and
algorithms for optimization problems such as packing linear programs
[177, 359].

The  treatment  of  gradient  descent  in  this  chapter  draws  heavily  on
the unpublished manuscript of Bansal and Gupta [35]. They emphasize
the  idea  of  using  a  potential  function  and  using  ideas  from  amortized
analysis  to  explain  gradient  descent.  Other  presentations  and  analyses

Gradient  descent  is  known  to  converge  faster  when  functions  obey
stronger properties than general convexity. For example, a function f is
α-strongly convex if f(y) ≥ f(x) + 〈(∇f)(x), (y – x)〉 + α∥y – x∥ for all x, y
n.  In  this  case,  GRADIENT-DESCENT  can  use  a  variable  step

size  and  return  x(T).  The  step  size  at  step  t  becomes  γt  =  1/(α(t  +  1)),
and the procedure returns a point such that f(x-avg) – f(x*) ≤ L2/(α(T +
1)).  This  convergence  is  better  than  that  of  Theorem  33.8  because  the
number  of  iterations  needed  is  linear,  rather  than  quadratic,  in  the
desired error parameter ϵ, and because the performance is independent
of the initial point.

Another  case  in  which  gradient  descent  can  be  shown  to  perform
better  than  the  analysis  in  Section  33.3  suggests  is  for  smooth  convex
