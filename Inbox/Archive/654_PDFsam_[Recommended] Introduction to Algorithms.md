18        B-Trees

B-trees are balanced search trees designed to work well on disk drives or
other direct-access secondary storage devices. B-trees are similar to red-
black trees (Chapter 13), but they are better at minimizing the number
of  operations  that  access  disks.  (We  often  say  just  “disk”  instead  of
“disk drive.”) Many database systems use B-trees, or variants of B-trees,
to store information.

B-trees  differ  from  red-black  trees  in  that  B-tree  nodes  may  have
many children, from a few to thousands. That is, the “branching factor”
of  a  B-tree  can  be  quite  large,  although  it  usually  depends  on
characteristics  of  the  disk  drive  used.  B-trees  are  similar  to  red-black
trees in that every n-node B-tree has height O(lg n), so that B-trees can
implement  many  dynamic-set  operations  in  O(lg  n)  time.  But  a  B-tree
has  a  larger  branching  factor  than  a  red-black  tree,  so  the  base  of  the
logarithm that expresses its height is larger, and hence its height can be
considerably lower.

B-trees  generalize  binary  search  trees  in  a  natural  manner.  Figure
18.1  shows  a  simple  B-tree.  If  an  internal  B-tree  node  x  contains  x.n
keys, then x has x.n + 1 children. The keys in node x serve as dividing
points separating the range of keys handled by x into x.n + 1 subranges,
each handled by one child of x. A search for a key in a B-tree makes an
(x.n + 1)-way decision based on comparisons with the x.n keys stored at
node  x.  An  internal  node  contains  pointers  to  its  children,  but  a  leaf
node does not.

Section 18.1 gives a precise deﬁnition of B-trees and proves that the
height of a B-tree grows only logarithmically with the number of nodes

it contains. Section 18.2 describes how to search for a key and insert a
key
into  a  B-tree,  and  Section  18.3  discusses  deletion.  Before
proceeding,  however,  we  need  to  ask  why  we  evaluate  data  structures
designed  to  work  on  a  disk  drive  differently  from  data  structures
designed to work in main random-access memory.

Figure 18.1 A B-tree whose keys are the consonants of English. An internal node x containing
x.n keys has x.n + 1 children. All leaves are at the same depth in the tree. The blue nodes are
examined in a search for the letter R.

Data structures on secondary storage

Computer systems take advantage of various technologies that provide
memory  capacity.  The  main  memory  of  a  computer  system  normally
consists of silicon memory chips. This technology is typically more than
an  order  of  magnitude  more  expensive  per  bit  stored  than  magnetic
storage technology, such as tapes or disk drives. Most computer systems
also  have  secondary  storage  based  on  solid-state  drives  (SSDs)  or
magnetic  disk  drives.  The  amount  of  such  secondary  storage  often
exceeds  the  amount  of  primary  memory  by  one  to  two  orders  of
magnitude.  SSDs  have  faster  access  times  than  magnetic  disk  drives,
which  are  mechanical  devices.  In  recent  years,  SSD  capacities  have
increased  while  their  prices  have  decreased.  Magnetic  disk  drives
typically  have  much  higher  capacities  than  SSDs,  and  they  remain  a
more cost-effective means for storing massive amounts of information.
Disk drives that store several terabytes1 can be found for under $100.

Figure 18.2 shows a typical disk drive. The drive consists of one or
more  platters,  which  rotate  at  a  constant  speed  around  a  common
spindle. A magnetizable material covers the surface of each platter. The

drive reads and writes each platter by a head at the end of an arm. The
arms  can  move  their  heads  toward  or  away  from  the  spindle.  The
surface  that  passes  underneath  a  given  head  when  it  is  stationary  is
called a track.

Although  disk  drives  are  cheaper  and  have  higher  capacity  than
main  memory,  they  are  much,  much  slower  because  they  have  moving
mechanical parts. The mechanical motion has two components: platter
rotation and arm movement. As of this writing, commodity disk drives
rotate at speeds of 5400–15,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). Typical
speeds are 15,000 RPM in server-grade drives, 7200 RPM in drives for
desktops,  and  5400  RPM  in  drives  for  laptops.  Although  7200  RPM
may  seem  fast,  one  rotation  takes  8.33  milliseconds,  which  is  over  5
orders of magnitude longer than the 50 nanosecond access times (more
or  less)  commonly  found  for  main  memory.  In  other  words,  if  a
computer  waits  a  full  rotation  for  a  particular  item  to  come  under  the
read/write head, it could access main memory more than 100,000 times
during that span. The average wait is only half a rotation, but still, the
difference in access times for main memory compared with disk drives is
enormous.  Moving  the  arms  also  takes  some  time.  As  of  this  writing,
average  access  times  for  commodity  disk  drives  are  around  4
milliseconds.

Figure  18.2  A  typical  magnetic  disk  drive.  It  consists  of  one  or  more  platters  covered  with  a
magnetizable material (two platters are shown here) that rotate around a spindle. Each platter is
read  and  written  with  a  head,  shown  in  red,  at  the  end  of  an  arm.  Arms  rotate  around  a
common  pivot  axis.  A  track,  drawn  in  blue,  is  the  surface  that  passes  beneath  the  read/write
head when the head is stationary.

In  order  to  amortize  the  time  spent  waiting  for  mechanical
movements, also known as latency, disk drives access not just one item
but  several  at  a  time.  Information  is  divided  into  a  number  of  equal-
sized  blocks  of  bits  that  appear  consecutively  within  tracks,  and  each
disk read or write is of one or more entire blocks.2 Typical disk drives
have  block  sizes  running  from  512  to  4096  bytes.  Once  the  read/write
head is positioned correctly and the platter has rotated to the beginning
of the desired block, reading or writing a magnetic disk drive is entirely
electronic (aside from the rotation of the platter), and the disk drive can
quickly read or write large amounts of data.

Often,  accessing  a  block  of  information  and  reading  it  from  a  disk
drive  takes  longer  than  processing  all  the  information  read.  For  this
reason,  in  this  chapter  we’ll  look  separately  at  the  two  principal
components of the running time:

the number of disk accesses, and

the CPU (computing) time.

We  measure  the  number  of  disk  accesses  in  terms  of  the  number  of
blocks of information that need to be read from or written to the disk

drive.  Although  disk-access  time  is  not  constant—it  depends  on  the
distance between the current track and the desired track and also on the
initial rotational position of the platters—the number of blocks read or
written  provides  a  good  ﬁrst-order  approximation  of  the  total  time
spent accessing the disk drive.

In  a  typical  B-tree  application,  the  amount  of  data  handled  is  so
large that all the data do not ﬁt into main memory at once. The B-tree
algorithms copy selected blocks from disk into main memory as needed
and  write  back  onto  disk  the  blocks  that  have  changed.  B-tree
algorithms keep only a constant number of blocks in main memory at
any time, and thus the size of main memory does not limit the size of B-
trees that can be handled.

B-tree procedures need to be able to read information from disk into
main  memory  and  write  information  from  main  memory  to  disk.
Consider  some  object  x.  If  x  is  currently  in  the  computer’s  main
memory, then the code can refer to the attributes of x as usual: x.key,
for  example.  If  x  resides  on  disk,  however,  then  the  procedure  must
perform  the  operation  DISK-READ(x)  to  read  the  block  containing
object x into main memory before it can refer to x’s attributes. (Assume
that if x is already in main memory, then DISK-READ(x) requires no
disk  accesses:  it  is  a  “no-op.”)  Similarly,  procedures  call  DISK-
WRITE(x) to save any changes that have been made to the attributes of
object  x  by  writing  to  disk  the  block  containing  x.  Thus,  the  typical
pattern for working with an object is as follows:

x = a pointer to some object
DISK-READ(x)
operations that access and/or modify the attributes of x
DISK-WRITE(x)
other operations that access but do not modify attributes of x

// omitted if no attributes of x were changed

The system can keep only a limited number of blocks in main memory
at  any  one  time.  Our  B-tree  algorithms  assume  that  the  system
automatically  ﬂushes  from  main  memory  blocks  that  are  no  longer  in
use.

Since  in  most  systems  the  running  time  of  a  B-tree  algorithm
depends primarily on the number of DISK-READ and DISK-WRITE
operations  it  performs,  we  typically  want  each  of  these  operations  to
read  or  write  as  much  information  as  possible.  Thus,  a  B-tree  node  is
usually as large as a whole disk block, and this size limits the number of
children a B-tree node can have.

Figure 18.3 A B-tree of height 2 containing over one billion keys. Shown inside each node x is
x.n, the number of keys in x. Each internal node and leaf contains 1000 keys. This B-tree has
1001 nodes at depth 1 and over one million leaves at depth 2.

Large  B-trees  stored  on  disk  drives  often  have  branching  factors
between 50 and 2000, depending on the size of a key relative to the size
of  a  block.  A  large  branching  factor  dramatically  reduces  both  the
height of the tree and the number of disk accesses required to ﬁnd any
key.  Figure  18.3  shows  a  B-tree  with  a  branching  factor  of  1001  and
height  2  that  can  store  over  one  billion  keys.  Nevertheless,  if  the  root
node  is  kept  permanently  in  main  memory,  at  most  two  disk  accesses
sufﬁce to ﬁnd any key in this tree.

18.1    Deﬁnition of B-trees

To  keep  things  simple,  let’s  assume,  as  we  have  for  binary  search  trees
and red-black trees, that any satellite information associated with a key
resides in the same node as the key. In practice, you might actually store
with  each  key  just  a  pointer  to  another  disk  block  containing  the
satellite  information  for  that  key.  The  pseudocode  in  this  chapter
implicitly assumes that the satellite information associated with a key, or

the pointer to such satellite information, travels with the key whenever
the  key  is  moved  from  node  to  node.  A  common  variant  on  a  B-tree,
known as a B+-tree, stores all the satellite information in the leaves and
stores  only  keys  and  child  pointers  in  the  internal  nodes,  thus
maximizing the branching factor of the internal nodes.

A  B-tree  T  is  a  rooted  tree  with  root  T.root  having  the  following

properties:

1. Every node x has the following attributes:

a. x.n, the number of keys currently stored in node x,

b. the x.n keys themselves, x.key1, x.key2, … , x.keyx.n, stored in
monotonically increasing order, so that x.key1 ≤ x.key2 ≤ ⋯ ≤
x.keyx.n,

c. x.leaf, a boolean value that is TRUE if x is a leaf and FALSE

if x is an internal node.

2. Each internal node x also contains x.n + 1 pointers x.c1, x.c2, …
,  x.cx.n+1  to  its  children.  Leaf  nodes  have  no  children,  and  so
their ci attributes are undeﬁned.

3. The  keys  x.keyi  separate  the  ranges  of  keys  stored  in  each
subtree: if ki is any key stored in the subtree with root x.ci, then

k1 ≤ x.key1 ≤ k2 ≤ x.key2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ x.keyx.n ≤ kx.n+1.

4. All leaves have the same depth, which is the tree’s height h.

5. Nodes have lower and upper bounds on the number of keys they
can contain, expressed in terms of a ﬁxed integer t ≥ 2 called the
minimum degree of the B-tree:

a. Every node other than the root must have at least t − 1 keys.
Every internal node other than the root thus has at least t
children. If the tree is nonempty, the root must have at least
one key.

b. Every node may contain at most 2t − 1 keys. Therefore, an

internal node may have at most 2t children. We say that a node
is full if it contains exactly 2t − 1 keys.3

The simplest B-tree occurs when t = 2. Every internal node then has
either  2,  3,  or  4  children,  and  it  is  a  2-3-4  tree.  In  practice,  however,
much larger values of t yield B-trees with smaller height.

The height of a B-tree

The number of disk accesses required for most operations on a B-tree is
proportional to the height of the B-tree. The following theorem bounds
the worst-case height of a B-tree.

Figure 18.4 A B-tree of height 3 containing a minimum possible number of keys. Shown inside
each node x is x.n.

Theorem 18.1
If n ≥ 1, then for any n-key B-tree T of height h and minimum degree t ≥
2,

Proof   By deﬁnition, the root of a nonempty B-tree T contains at least
one  key,  and  all  other  nodes  contain  at  least  t  −  1  keys.  Let  h  be  the
height  of  T.  Then  T  contains  at  least  2  nodes  at  depth  1,  at  least  2t

nodes at depth 2, at least 2t2 nodes at depth 3, and so on, until at depth
h, it has at least 2th−1 nodes. Figure 18.4 illustrates such a tree for h =
3. The number n of keys therefore satisﬁes the inequality

so that th ≤ (n + 1)/2. Taking base-t logarithms of both sides proves the
theorem.

▪

You can see the power of B-trees as compared with red-black trees.
Although the height of the tree grows as O(log n) in both cases (recall
that t is a constant), for B-trees the base of the logarithm can be many
times  larger.  Thus,  B-trees  save  a  factor  of  about  lg  t  over  red-black
trees  in  the  number  of  nodes  examined  for  most  tree  operations.
Because examining an arbitrary node in a tree usually entails accessing
the disk, B-trees avoid a substantial number of disk accesses.

18.2    Basic operations on B-trees

This section presents the details of the operations B-TREE-SEARCH,
B-TREE-CREATE,  and  B-TREE-INSERT.  These  procedures  observe
two conventions:

The  root  of  the  B-tree  is  always  in  main  memory,  so  that  no
procedure  ever  needs  to  perform  a  DISK-READ  on  the  root.  If
any changes to the root node occur, however, then DISK-WRITE
must be called on the root.

Any nodes that are passed as parameters must already have had a
DISK-READ operation performed on them.

The  procedures  are  all  “one-pass”  algorithms  that  proceed  downward
from the root of the tree, without having to back up.

Searching a B-tree

Searching  a  B-tree  is  much  like  searching  a  binary  search  tree,  except
that  instead  of  making  a  binary,  or  “two-way,”  branching  decision  at
each  node,  the  search  makes  a  multiway  branching  decision  according
to  the  number  of  the  node’s  children.  More  precisely,  at  each  internal
node x, the search makes an (x.n + 1)-way branching decision.

The procedure B-TREE-SEARCH generalizes the TREE-SEARCH
procedure deﬁned for binary search trees on page 316. It takes as input
a pointer to the root node x of a subtree and a key k to be searched for
in  that  subtree.  The  top-level  call  is  thus  of  the  form  B-TREE-
SEARCH(T.root,  k).  If  k  is  in  the  B-tree,  then  B-TREE-SEARCH
returns the ordered pair (y, i) consisting of a node y and an index i such
that y.keyi = k. Otherwise, the procedure returns NIL.

B-TREE-SEARCH(x, k)

i = i + 1

1 i = 1
2 while i ≤ x.n and k > x.keyi
3
4 if i ≤ x.n and k == x.keyi
5
6 elseif x.leaf
7
8 else DISK-READ(x.ci)
9

return (x, i)

returnNIL

return B-TREE-SEARCH(x.ci, k)

Using  a  linear-search  procedure,  lines  1–3  of  B-TREE-SEARCH
ﬁnd the smallest index i such that k ≤ x.keyi, or else they set i to x.n + 1.
Lines  4–5  check  to  see  whether  the  search  has  discovered  the  key,
returning  if  it  has.  Otherwise,  if  x  is  a  leaf,  then  line  7  terminates  the
search unsuccessfully, and if x is an internal node, lines 8–9 recurse to
search  the  appropriate  subtree  of  x,  after  performing  the  necessary
DISK-READ on that child. Figure 18.1 illustrates the operation of B-
TREE-SEARCH.  The  blue  nodes  are  those  examined  during  a  search
for the key R.

As  in  the  TREE-SEARCH  procedure  for  binary  search  trees,  the
nodes encountered during the recursion form a simple path downward
from  the  root  of  the  tree.  The  B-TREE-SEARCH  procedure  therefore
accesses O(h) = O(logt n) disk blocks, where h is the height of the B-tree
and n is the number of keys in the B-tree. Since x.n < 2t, the while loop
of lines 2–3 takes O(t) time within each node, and the total CPU time is
O(th) = O(t logtn).

Creating an empty B-tree

To  build  a  B-tree  T,  ﬁrst  use  the  B-TREE-CREATE  procedure  on  the
next  page  to  create  an  empty  root  node  and  then  call  the  B-TREE-
INSERT  procedure  on  page  508  to  add  new  keys.  Both  of  these
procedures  use  an  auxiliary  procedure  ALLOCATE-NODE,  whose
pseudocode we omit and which allocates one disk block to be used as a
new node in O(1) time. A node created by ALLOCATE-NODE requires

no DISK-READ, since there is as yet no useful information stored on
the disk for that node. B-TREE-CREATE requires O(1) disk operations
and O(1) CPU time.

B-TREE-CREATE(T)

1 x = ALLOCATE-NODE()
2 x.leaf = TRUE
3 x.n = 0
4 DISK-WRITE(x)
5 T.root = x

Inserting a key into a B-tree

Inserting  a  key  into  a  B-tree  is  signiﬁcantly  more  complicated  than
inserting  a  key  into  a  binary  search  tree.  As  with  binary  search  trees,
you search for the leaf position at which to insert the new key. With a B-
tree, however, you cannot simply create a new leaf node and insert it, as
the resulting tree would fail to be a valid B-tree. Instead, you insert the
new key into an existing leaf node. Since you cannot insert a key into a
leaf  node  that  is  full,  you  need  an  operation  that  splits  a  full  node  y
(having 2t − 1 keys) around its median key y.keyt into two nodes having
only  t  −  1  keys  each.  The  median  key  moves  up  into  y’s  parent  to
identify the dividing point between the two new trees. But if y’s parent is
also  full,  you  must  split  it  before  you  can  insert  the  new  key,  and  thus
you could end up splitting full nodes all the way up the tree.

To avoid having to go back up the tree, just split every full node you
encounter  as  you  go  down  the  tree.  In  this  way,  whenever  you  need  to
split  a  full  node,  you  are  assured  that  its  parent  is  not  full.  Inserting  a
key into a B-tree then requires only a single pass down the tree from the
root to a leaf.

Splitting a node in a B-tree

The  procedure  B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD  on  the  facing  page  takes  as
input a nonfull internal node x (assumed to reside in main memory) and

an index i such that x.ci (also assumed to reside in main memory) is a
full  child  of  x.  The  procedure  splits  this  child  in  two  and  adjusts  x  so
that it has an additional child. To split a full root, you ﬁrst need to make
the root a child of a new empty root node, so that you can use B-TREE-
SPLIT-CHILD. The tree thus grows in height by 1: splitting is the only
means by which the tree grows taller.

B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD(x, i)
  1 y = x.ci
  2 z = ALLOCATE-NODE()
  3 z.leaf = y.leaf
  4 z.n = t − 1
  5 for j = 1 to t − 1
  6
  7 if not y.leaf
  8

z.keyj = y.keyj+t

for j = 1 to t

z.cj = y.cj+t

x.cj+1 = x.cj

  9
10 y.n = t − 1
11 for j = x.n + 1 downto i + 1
12
13 x.ci+1 = z
14 for j = x.ndownto i
15
16 x.keyi = y.keyt
17 x.n = x.n + 1
18 DISK-WRITE(y)
19 DISK-WRITE(z)
20 DISK-WRITE(x)

x.keyj+1 = x.keyj

// full node to split
// z will take half of y

// z gets y’s greatest keys …

// … and its corresponding children

// y keeps t − 1 keys
// shift x’s children to the right …

// … to make room for z as a child
// shift the corresponding keys in x

// insert y’s median key
// x has gained a child

Figure  18.5  illustrates  how  a  node  splits.  B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD
splits the full node y = x.ci about its median key (S in the ﬁgure), which
moves up into y’s parent node x. Those keys in y that are greater than

the median key move into a new node z, which becomes a new child of
x.

B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD  works  by  straightforward  cutting  and
pasting. Node x is the parent of the node y being split, which is x’s ith
child (set in line 1). Node y originally has 2t children and 2t − 1 keys,
but splitting reduces y to t children and t − 1 keys. The t largest children
and  t  −  1  keys  of  node  y  move  over  to  node  z,  which  becomes  a  new
child  of  x,  positioned  just  after  y  in  x’s  table  of  children.  The  median
key  of  y  moves  up  to  become  the  key  in  node  x  that  separates  the
pointers to nodes y and z.

Lines 2–9 create node z and give it the largest t − 1 keys and, if y and
z are internal nodes, the corresponding t children of y. Line 10 adjusts
the key count for y. Then, lines 11–17 shift keys and child pointers in x
to the right in order to make room for x’s new child, insert z as a new
child of x, move the median key from y up to x in order to separate y
from z, and adjust x’s key count. Lines 18–20 write out all modiﬁed disk
blocks. The CPU time used by B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD is Θ(t), due to
the for loops in lines 5–6 and 8–9. (The for loops in lines 11–12 and 14–
15  also  run  for  O(t)  iterations.)  The  procedure  performs  O(1)  disk
operations.

Figure  18.5  Splitting  a  node  with  t  =  4.  Node  y  =  x.ci  splits  into  two  nodes,  y  and  z,  and  the
median key S of y moves up into y’s parent.

Inserting a key into a B-tree in a single pass down the tree

Inserting a key k into a B-tree T of height h requires just a single pass
down the tree and O(h) disk accesses. The CPU time required is O(th) =
O(t  logt  n).  The  B-TREE-INSERT  procedure  uses  B-TREE-SPLIT-
CHILD to guarantee that the recursion never descends to a full node. If
the  root  is  full,  B-TREE-INSERT  splits  it  by  calling  the  procedure  B-
TREE-SPLIT-ROOT on the facing page.

B-TREE-INSERT(T, k)

1 r = T.root
2 if r.n == 2t − 1
3

s = B-TREE-SPLIT-ROOT(T)
B-TREE-INSERT-NONFULL(s, k)
4
5 else B-TREE-INSERT-NONFULL(r, k)

B-TREE-INSERT  works  as  follows.  If  the  root  is  full,  then  line  3
calls B-TREE-SPLIT-ROOT in line 3 to split it. A new node s (with two
children) becomes the root and is returned by B-TREE-SPLIT-ROOT.
Splitting the root, illustrated in Figure 18.6, is the only way to increase
the height of a B-tree. Unlike a binary search tree, a B-tree increases in
height  at  the  top  instead  of  at  the  bottom.  Regardless  of  whether  the
root  split,  B-TREE-INSERT  ﬁnishes  by  calling  B-TREE-INSERT-
NONFULL to insert key k into the tree rooted at the nonfull root node,
which is either the new root (the call in line 4) or the original root (the
call in line 5).

Figure  18.6  Splitting  the  root  with  t  =  4.  Root  node  r  splits  in  two,  and  a  new  root  node  s  is
created. The new root contains the median key of r and has the two halves of r as children. The
B-tree grows in height by one when the root is split. A B-tree’s height increases only when the
root splits.

B-TREE-SPLIT-ROOT(T)

1 s = ALLOCATE-NODE()
2 s.leaf = FALSE
3 s.n = 0
4 s.c1 = T.root
5 T.root = s
6 B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD(s, 1)
7 return s

The auxiliary procedure B-TREE-INSERT-NONFULL on page 511
inserts  key  k  into  node  x,  which  is  assumed  to  be  nonfull  when  the
procedure is called. B-TREEINSERT-NONFULL recurses as necessary
down  the  tree,  at  all  times  guaranteeing  that  the  node  to  which  it
recurses is not full by calling B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD as necessary. The
operation  of  B-TREE-INSERT  and  the  recursive  operation  of  B-
TREE-INSERT-NONFULL guarantee that this assumption is true.

Figure  18.7  illustrates  the  various  cases  of  how  B-TREE-INSERT-
NONFULL  inserts  a  key  into  a  B-tree.  Lines  3–8  handle  the  case  in
which x is a leaf node by inserting key k into x, shifting to the right all
keys in x that are greater than k. If x is not a leaf node, then k should

go into the appropriate leaf node in the subtree rooted at internal node
x. Lines 9–11 determine the child x.ci to which the recursion descends.
Line 13 detects whether the recursion would descend to a full child, in
which case line 14 calls B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD to split that child into
two  nonfull  children,  and  lines  15–16  determine  which  of  the  two
children is the correct one to descend to. (Note that DISK-READ(x.ci)
is not needed after line 16 increments i, since the recursion descends in
this  case  to  a  child  that  was  just  created  by  B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD.)
The  net  effect  of  lines  13–16  is  thus  to  guarantee  that  the  procedure
never recurses to a full node. Line 17 then recurses to insert k into the
appropriate subtree.

For  a  B-tree  of  height  h,  B-TREE-INSERT  performs  O(h)  disk
accesses,  since  only  O(1)  DISK-READ  and  DISK-WRITE  operations
occur at each level of the tree. The total CPU time used is O(t) in each
level of the tree, or O(th) = O(t logt n) overall. Since B-TREE-INSERT-
NONFULL is tail-recursive, you can instead implement it with a while
loop, thereby demonstrating that the number of blocks that need to be
in main memory at any time is O(1).

Explain  under  what  circumstances,  if  any,  redundant  DISK-READ  or
DISK-WRITE operations occur during the course of executing a call to
B-TREE-INSERT. (A redundant DISK-READ is a DISK-READ for a
block that is already in memory. A redundant DISK-WRITE writes to
disk  a  block  of  information  that  is  identical  to  what  is  already  stored
there.)

18.2-3
Professor  Bunyan  asserts  that  the  B-TREE-INSERT  procedure  always
results  in  a  B-tree  with  the  minimum  possible  height.  Show  that  the
professor is mistaken by proving that with t = 2 and the set of keys {1,
2, … , 15}, there is no insertion sequence that results in a B-tree with the
minimum possible height.

If you insert the keys {1, 2, … , n} into an empty B-tree with minimum
degree 2, how many nodes does the ﬁnal B-tree have?

Since leaf nodes require no pointers to children, they could conceivably
use  a  different  (larger)  t  value  than  internal  nodes  for  the  same  disk

inserting into a B-tree to handle this variation.

18.2-6
Suppose  that  you  implement  B-TREE-SEARCH  to  use  binary  search
rather than linear search within each node. Show that this change makes
the required CPU time O(lg n), independent of how t might be chosen
as a function of n.

18.2-7
Suppose  that  disk  hardware  allows  you  to  choose  the  size  of  a  disk
block  arbitrarily,  but  that  the  time  it  takes  to  read  the  disk  block  is
a+bt, where a and b are speciﬁed constants and t is the minimum degree

for a B-tree using blocks of the selected size. Describe how to choose t
so  as  to  minimize  (approximately)  the  B-tree  search  time.  Suggest  an
optimal value of t for the case in which a = 5 milliseconds and b = 10
microseconds.

18.3    Deleting a key from a B-tree

Deletion  from  a  B-tree  is  analogous  to  insertion  but  a  little  more
complicated,  because  you  can  delete  a  key  from  any  node—not  just  a
leaf—and  when  you  delete  a  key  from  an  internal  node,  you  must
rearrange  the  node’s  children.  As  in  insertion,  you  must  guard  against
deletion producing a tree whose structure violates the B-tree properties.
Just as a node should not get too big due to insertion, a node must not
get  too  small  during  deletion  (except  that  the  root  is  allowed  to  have
fewer  than  the  minimum  number  t  −  1  of  keys).  And  just  as  a  simple
insertion  algorithm  might  have  to  back  up  if  a  node  on  the  path  to
where  the  key  is  to  be  inserted  is  full,  a  simple  approach  to  deletion
might have to back up if a node (other than the root) along the path to
where the key is to be deleted has the minimum number of keys.

The procedure B-TREE-DELETE deletes the key k from the subtree
rooted  at  x.  Unlike  the  procedures  TREE-DELETE  on  page  325  and
RB-DELETE  on  page  348,  which  are  given  the  node  to  delete—
presumably  as  the  result  of  a  prior  search—B-TREE-DELETE
combines  the  search  for  key  k  with  the  deletion  process.  Why  do  we
combine  search  and  deletion  in  B-TREE-DELETE?  Just  as  B-TREE-
INSERT prevents any node from becoming overfull (having more than
2t  −  1  keys)  while  making  a  single  pass  down  the  tree,  B-TREE-
DELETE  prevents  any  node  from  becoming  underfull  (having  fewer
than t − 1 keys) while also making a single pass down the tree, searching
for and ultimately deleting the key.

To  prevent  any  node  from  becoming  underfull,  the  design  of  B-
TREE-DELETE guarantees that whenever it calls itself recursively on a
node x, the number of keys in x is at least the minimum degree t at the
time  of  the  call.  (Although  the  root  may  have  fewer  than  t  keys  and  a
recursive  call  may  be  made  from  the  root,  no  recursive  call  is  made  on

the  root.)  This  condition  requires  one  more  key  than  the  minimum
required by the usual B-tree conditions, and so a key might have to be
moved from x into one of its child nodes (still leaving x with at least the
minimum t − 1 keys) before a recursive call is made on that child, thus
allowing  deletion  to  occur  in  one  downward  pass  without  having  to
traverse back up the tree.

We  describe  how  the  procedure  B-TREE-DELETE(T,  k)  deletes  a
key  k  from  a  B-tree  T  instead  of  presenting  detailed  pseudocode.  We
examine  three  cases,  illustrated  in  Figure  18.8.  The  cases  are  for  when
the search arrives at a leaf, at an internal node containing key k, and at
an internal node not containing key k. As mentioned above, in all three
cases node x has at least t keys (with the possible exception of when x is
the  root).  Cases  2  and  3—when  x  is  an  internal  node—guarantee  this
property as the recursion descends through the B-tree.

Case  1:  The  search  arrives  at  a  leaf  node  x.  If  x  contains  key  k,  then

by  the  deletion  process.  (a)  The  B-tree  of  Figure  18.7(e).  (b)  Deletion  of  F,  which  is  case  1:

M’s position. (d) Deletion of G, which is case 2c: push G down to make node DEGJK and then

subtree rooted at x.ci. Recursively delete k′ from x.ci, and replace k by
k′ in x. (Key k′ can be found and deleted in a single downward pass.)
Case 2b: x.ci has t − 1 keys and x.ci+1has at least t keys. This case is
symmetric to case 2a. Find the successor k′ of k in the subtree rooted
at x.ci+1. Recursively delete k′ from x.ci+1, and replace k by k′ in x.
(Again,  ﬁnding  and  deleting  k′  can  be  done  in  a  single  downward
pass.)
Case 2c: Both x.ci and x.ci+1have t − 1 keys. Merge k and all of x.ci+1
into x.ci, so that x loses both k and the pointer to x.ci+1, and x.ci now
contains  2t  −  1  keys.  Then  free  x.ci+1  and  recursively  delete  k  from
x.ci.

Case 3: The search arrives at an internal node x that does not contain key
k.  Continue  searching  down  the  tree  while  ensuring  that  each  node
visited  has  at  least  t  keys.  To  do  so,  determine  the  root  x.ci  of  the
appropriate subtree that must contain k, if k is in the tree at all. If x.ci
has  only  t  −  1  keys,  execute  case  3a  or  3b  as  necessary  to  guarantee
descending  to  a  node  containing  at  least  t  keys.  Then  ﬁnish  by
recursing on the appropriate child of x.
Case  3a:  x.ci  has  only  t  −  1  keys  but  has  an  immediate  sibling  with  at
least t keys. Give x.ci an extra key by moving a key from x down into
x.ci, moving a key from x.ci’s immediate left or right sibling up into x,
and moving the appropriate child pointer from the sibling into x.ci.

Case 3b: x.ci and each of x.ci’s immediate siblings have t − 1 keys. (It is
possible  for  x.ci  to  have  either  one  or  two  siblings.)  Merge  x.ci  with
one  sibling,  which  involves  moving  a  key  from  x  down  into  the  new
merged node to become the median key for that node.

In cases 2c and 3b, if node x is the root, it could end up having no
keys.  When  this  situation  occurs,  then  x  is  deleted,  and  x’s  only  child
x.c1 becomes the new root of the tree. This action decreases the height
of  the  tree  by  one  and  preserves  the  property  that  the  root  of  the  tree
contains at least one key (unless the tree is empty).

Since  most  of  the  keys  in  a  B-tree  are  in  the  leaves,  deletion
operations  often  end  up  deleting  keys  from  leaves.  The  B-TREE-
DELETE procedure then acts in one downward pass through the tree,
without having to back up. When deleting a key in an internal node x,
however, the procedure might make a downward pass through the tree
to ﬁnd the key’s predecessor or successor and then return to node x to
replace  the  key  with  its  predecessor  or  successor  (cases  2a  and  2b).
Returning  to  node  x  does  not  require  a  traversal  through  all  the  levels
between  x  and  the  node  containing  the  predecessor  or  successor,
however,  since  the  procedure  can  just  keep  a  pointer  to  x  and  the  key
position  within  x  and  put  the  predecessor  or  successor  key  directly
there.

Although  this  procedure  seems  complicated,  it  involves  only  O(h)
disk operations for a B-tree of height h, since only O(1) calls to DISK-
READ  and  DISK-WRITE  are  made  between  recursive  invocations  of
the procedure. The CPU time required is O(th) = O(t logtn).

Problems

18-1     Stacks on secondary storage

Consider implementing a stack in a computer that has a relatively small
amount of fast primary memory and a relatively large amount of slower
disk  storage.  The  operations  PUSH  and  POP  work  on  single-word
values.  The  stack  can  grow  to  be  much  larger  than  can  ﬁt  in  memory,
and thus most of it must be stored on disk.

A simple, but inefﬁcient, stack implementation keeps the entire stack
on disk. Maintain in memory a stack pointer, which is the disk address
of  the  top  element  on  the  stack.  Indexing  block  numbers  and  word
offsets within blocks from 0, if the pointer has value p, the top element
is  the  (p  mod  m)th  word  on  block  ⌊p/m⌋  of  the  disk,  where  m  is  the
number of words per block.

To  implement  the  PUSH  operation,  increment  the  stack  pointer,
read the appropriate block into memory from disk, copy the element to
be  pushed  to  the  appropriate  word  on  the  block,  and  write  the  block
back to disk. A POP operation is similar. Read in the appropriate block
from  disk,  save  the  top  of  the  stack,  decrement  the  stack  pointer,  and
return the saved value. You need not write back the block, since it was
not  modiﬁed,  and  the  word  in  the  block  that  contained  the  popped
value is ignored.

As  in  the  analyses  of  B-tree  operations,  two  costs  matter:  the  total
number  of  disk  accesses  and  the  total  CPU  time.  A  disk  access  also
incurs a cost in CPU time. In particular, any disk access to a block of m
words incurs charges of one disk access and Θ(m) CPU time.
a. Asymptotically, what is the worst-case number of disk accesses for n
stack operations using this simple implementation? What is the CPU
time for n stack operations? Express your answer in terms of m and n
for this and subsequent parts.

Now  consider  a  stack  implementation  in  which  you  keep  one  block  of
the stack in memory. (You also maintain a small amount of memory to
record  which  block  is  currently  in  memory.)  You  can  perform  a  stack
operation  only  if  the  relevant  disk  block  resides  in  memory.  If

necessary, you can write the block currently in memory to the disk and
read  the  new  block  from  the  disk  into  memory.  If  the  relevant  disk
block is already in memory, then no disk accesses are required.

b. What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for n PUSH

operations? What is the CPU time?

c. What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for n stack

operations? What is the CPU time?

Suppose  that  you  now  implement  the  stack  by  keeping  two  blocks  in
memory (in addition to a small number of words for bookkeeping).

d. Describe how to manage the stack blocks so that the amortized

number of disk accesses for any stack operation is O(1/m) and the
amortized CPU time for any stack operation is O(1).

18-2     Joining and splitting 2-3-4 trees
The join operation takes two dynamic sets S′ and S″ and an element x
such that x′.key < x.key < x″.key for any x′ ∈ S′ and x″ ∈ S″. It returns
a  set  S  =  S′  ∪  {x}  ∪  S″.  The  split  operation  is  like  an  “inverse”  join:
given  a  dynamic  set  S  and  an  element  x  ∈  S,  it  creates  a  set  S′  that
consists of all elements in S − {x} whose keys are less than x.key and
another  set  S″  that  consists  of  all  elements  in  S  −  {x}  whose  keys  are
greater  than  x.key.  This  problem  investigates  how  to  implement  these
operations on 2-3-4 trees (B-trees with t = 2). Assume for convenience
that elements consist only of keys and that all key values are distinct.

a. Show how to maintain, for every node x of a 2-3-4 tree, the height of
the subtree rooted at x as an attribute x.height. Make sure that your
implementation does not affect the asymptotic running times of
searching, insertion, and deletion.

b. Show how to implement the join operation. Given two 2-3-4 trees T′
and T″ and a key k, the join operation should run in O(1 + |h′ − h″|)
time, where h′ and h″ are the heights of T′ and T″, respectively.

c. Consider the simple path p from the root of a 2-3-4 tree T to a given
key k, the set S′ of keys in T that are less than k, and the set S″ of

d. Show how to implement the split operation on T. Use the join

operation to assemble the keys in S′ into a single 2-3-4 tree T′ and the
keys in S″ into a single 2-3-4 tree T″. The running time of the split
operation should be O(lg n), where n is the number of keys in T.
(Hint: The costs for joining should telescope.)

Chapter notes

Knuth  [261],  Aho,  Hopcroft,  and  Ullman  [5],  and  Sedgewick  and
Wayne  [402]  give  further  discussions  of  balanced-tree  schemes  and  B-
trees.  Comer  [99]  provides  a  comprehensive  survey  of  B-trees.  Guibas
and  Sedgewick  [202]  discuss  the  relationships  among  various  kinds  of
balanced-tree schemes, including red-black trees and 2-3-4 trees.

In 1970, J. E. Hopcroft invented 2-3 trees, a precursor to B-trees and
2-3-4 trees, in which every internal node has either two or three children.
Bayer  and  McCreight  [39]  introduced  B-trees  in  1972  with  no
explanation of their choice of name.

Bender,  Demaine,  and  Farach-Colton  [47]  studied  how  to  make  B-
trees  perform  well  in  the  presence  of  memory-hierarchy  effects.  Their
cache-oblivious  algorithms  work  efﬁciently  without  explicitly  knowing
the data transfer sizes within the memory hierarchy.

1 When specifying disk capacities, one terabyte is one trillion bytes, rather than 240 bytes.
2 SSDs also exhibit greater latency than main memory and access data in blocks.
3 Another common variant on a B-tree, known as a B*-tree, requires each internal node to be at
least 2/3 full, rather than at least half full, as a B-tree requires.
