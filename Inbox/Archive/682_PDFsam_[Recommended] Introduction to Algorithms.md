19        Data Structures for Disjoint Sets

Some applications involve grouping n distinct elements into a collection
of  disjoint  sets—sets  with  no  elements  in  common.  These  applications
often  need  to  perform  two  operations  in  particular:  ﬁnding  the  unique
set  that  contains  a  given  element  and  uniting  two  sets.  This  chapter
explores  methods  for  maintaining  a  data  structure  that  supports  these
operations.

Section 19.1 describes the operations supported by a disjoint-set data
structure  and  presents  a  simple  application.  Section  19.2  looks  at  a
simple linked-list implementation for disjoint sets. Section 19.3 presents
a  more  efﬁcient  representation  using  rooted  trees.  The  running  time
using  the  tree  representation  is  theoretically  superlinear,  but  for  all
practical  purposes  it  is  linear.  Section  19.4  deﬁnes  and  discusses  a  very
quickly  growing  function  and  its  very  slowly  growing  inverse,  which
appears
in  the  running  time  of  operations  on  the  tree-based
implementation,  and  then,  by  a  complex  amortized  analysis,  proves  an
upper bound on the running time that is just barely superlinear.

19.1    Disjoint-set operations

A disjoint-set data structure maintains a collection S = {S1, S2, … , Sk}
of  disjoint  dynamic  sets.  To  identify  each  set,  choose  a  representative,
which is some member of the set. In some applications, it doesn’t matter
which  member  is  used  as  the  representative;  it  matters  only  that  if  you
ask for the representative of a dynamic set twice without modifying the

set  between  the  requests,  you  get  the  same  answer  both  times.  Other
applications  may  require  a  prespeciﬁed  rule
the
representative, such as choosing the smallest member in the set (for a set
whose elements can be ordered).

for  choosing

As  in  the  other  dynamic-set  implementations  we  have  studied,  each
element of a set is represented by an object. Letting x denote an object,
we’ll see how to support the following operations:

MAKE-SET(x),  where  x  does  not  already  belong  to  some  other  set,
creates a new set whose only member (and thus representative) is x.

implementations  of  UNION

UNION(x, y) unites two disjoint, dynamic sets that contain x and y, say
Sx  and  Sy,  into  a  new  set  that  is  the  union  of  these  two  sets.  The
representative of the resulting set is any member of Sx ∪ Sy, although
many
the
representative  of  either  Sx  or  Sy  as  the  new  representative.  Since  the
sets  in  the  collection  must  at  all  times  be  disjoint,  the  UNION
operation destroys sets Sx and Sy, removing them from the collection
S.  In  practice,  implementations  often  absorb  the  elements  of  one  of
the sets into the other set.

speciﬁcally

choose

FIND-SET(x)  returns  a  pointer  to  the  representative  of  the  unique  set

containing x.

Throughout this chapter, we’ll analyze the running times of disjoint-
set data structures in terms of two parameters: n, the number of MAKE-
SET operations, and m, the total number of MAKE-SET, UNION, and
FIND-SET  operations.  Because  the  total  number  of  operations  m
includes the n MAKE-SET operations, m ≥ n. The ﬁrst n operations are
always  MAKE-SET  operations,  so  that  after  the  ﬁrst  n  operations,  the
collection  consists  of  n  singleton  sets.  Since  the  sets  are  disjoint  at  all
times, each UNION operation reduces the number of sets by 1. After n
− 1 UNION operations, therefore, only one set remains, and so at most n
− 1 UNION operations can occur.

An application of disjoint-set data structures

One  of  the  many  applications  of  disjoint-set  data  structures  arises  in
determining  the  connected  components  of  an  undirected  graph  (see
Section  B.4).  Figure  19.1(a),  for  example,  shows  a  graph  with  four
connected components.

The  procedure  CONNECTED-COMPONENTS  on  the  following
page  uses  the  disjoint-set  operations  to  compute  the  connected
components  of  a  graph.  Once  the  CONNECTED-COMPONENTS
procedure  has  preprocessed
the  procedure  SAME-
COMPONENT  answers  queries  about  whether  two  vertices  belong  to
the  same  connected  component.  In  pseudocode,  we  denote  the  set  of
vertices of a graph G by G.V and the set of edges by G.E.

the  graph,

The procedure CONNECTED-COMPONENTS initially places each
vertex  v  in  its  own  set.  Then,  for  each  edge  (u,  v),  it  unites  the  sets
containing u and v. By Exercise 19.1-2, after all the edges are processed,
two vertices belong to the same connected component if and only if the
objects  corresponding  to  the  vertices  belong  to  the  same  set.  Thus
CONNECTED-COMPONENTS  computes  sets  in  such  a  way  that  the
procedure  SAME-COMPONENT  can  determine  whether  two  vertices
are  in  the  same  connected  component.  Figure  19.1(b)  illustrates  how
CONNECTED-COMPONENTS computes the disjoint sets.

In  an  actual

implementation  of

this  connected-components
algorithm,  the  representations  of  the  graph  and  the  disjoint-set  data
structure  would  need  to  reference  each  other.  That  is,  an  object
representing  a  vertex  would  contain  a  pointer  to  the  corresponding
disjoint-set  object,  and  vice  versa.  Since  these  programming  details
depend on the implementation language, we do not address them further
here.

When  the  edges  of  the  graph  are  static—not  changing  over  time—
depth-ﬁrst  search  can  compute  the  connected  components  faster  (see
Exercise 20.3-12 on page 572). Sometimes, however, the edges are added
dynamically,  with  the  connected  components  updated  as  each  edge  is
added. In this case, the implementation given here can be more efﬁcient
than running a new depth-ﬁrst search for each new edge.

19.2    Linked-list representation of disjoint sets

Figure  19.2(a)  shows  a  simple  way  to  implement  a  disjoint-set  data
structure:  each  set  is  represented  by  its  own  linked  list.  The  object  for
each  set  has  attributes  head,  pointing  to  the  ﬁrst  object  in  the  list,  and
tail,  pointing  to  the  last  object.  Each  object  in  the  list  contains  a  set
member, a pointer to the next object in the list, and a pointer back to the
set object. Within each linked list, the objects may appear in any order.
The representative is the set member in the ﬁrst object in the list.

With  this  linked-list  representation,  both  MAKE-SET  and  FIND-
SET require only O(1) time. To carry out MAKE-SET(x), create a new
linked  list  whose  only  object  is  x.  For  FIND-SET(x),  just  follow  the
pointer from x back to its set object and then return the member in the
object that head points to. For example, in Figure 19.2(a), the call FIND-
SET(g) returns f.

Figure 19.2 (a) Linked-list representations of two sets. Set S1 contains members d, f, and g, with
representative f, and set S2 contains members b, c, e, and h, with representative c. Each object in
the list contains a set member, a pointer to the next object in the list, and a pointer back to the set
object. Each set object has pointers head and tail to the ﬁrst and last objects, respectively. (b) The
result of UNION(g, e), which appends the linked list containing e to the linked list containing g.
The representative of the resulting set is f. The set object for e’s list, S2, is destroyed.

A simple implementation of union

The simplest implementation of the UNION operation using the linked-
list set representation takes signiﬁcantly more time than MAKE-SET or
FIND-SET.  As  Figure  19.2(b)  shows,  the  operation  UNION(x,  y)
appends  y’s  list  onto  the  end  of  x’s  list.  The  representative  of  x’s  list
becomes the representative of the resulting set. To quickly ﬁnd where to
append y’s list, use the tail pointer for x’s list. Because all members of y’s
list join x’s list, the UNION operation destroys the set object for y’s list.
The  UNION  operation  is  where  this  implementation  pays  the  price  for
FIND-SET taking constant time: UNION must also update the pointer
to  the  set  object  for  each  object  originally  on  y’s  list,  which  takes  time
linear in the length of y’s list. In Figure 19.2, for example, the operation
UNION(g, e) causes pointers to be updated in the objects for b, c, e, and
h.

In fact, we can construct a sequence of m operations on n objects that
requires  Θ(n2)  time.  Starting  with  objects  x1,  x2,  …  ,  xn,  execute  the
sequence  of  n  MAKE-SET  operations  followed  by  n  −  1  UNION
operations shown in Figure 19.3, so that m = 2n−1. The n MAKE-SET
operations take Θ(n) time. Because the ith UNION operation updates i
objects,  the  total  number  of  objects  updated  by  all  n−1  UNION
operations forms an arithmetic series:

Figure 19.3 A sequence of 2n − 1 operations on n objects that takes Θ(n2) time, or Θ(n) time per
operation  on  average,  using  the  linked-list  set  representation  and  the  simple  implementation  of
UNION.

The  total  number  of  operations  is  2n−1,  and  so  each  operation  on
average requires Θ(n) time. That is, the amortized time of an operation is
Θ(n).

A weighted-union heuristic

In  the  worst  case,  the  above  implementation  of  UNION  requires  an
average of Θ(n) time per call, because it might be appending a longer list
onto a shorter list, and the procedure must update the pointer to the set
object for each member of the longer list. Suppose instead that each list
list  (which  can  be  maintained
also
straightforwardly  with  constant  overhead)  and  that  the  UNION

length  of  the

includes  the

procedure always appends the shorter list onto the longer, breaking ties
arbitrarily.  With  this  simple  weighted-union  heuristic,  a  single  UNION
operation can still take Ω(n) time if both sets have Ω(n) members. As the
following  theorem  shows,  however,  a  sequence  of  m  MAKE-SET,
UNION,  and  FIND-SET  operations,  n  of  which  are  MAKE-SET
operations, takes O(m + n lg n) time.

Theorem 19.1
Using  the  linked-list  representation  of  disjoint  sets  and  the  weighted-
union heuristic, a sequence of m MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET
operations, n of which are MAKE-SET operations, takes O(m + n lg n)
time.

Proof   Because each UNION operation unites two disjoint sets, at most
n − 1 UNION operations occur over all. We now bound the total time
taken  by  these  UNION  operations.  We  start  by  determining,  for  each
object, an upper bound on the number of times the object’s pointer back
to its set object is updated. Consider a particular object x. Each time x’s
pointer is updated, x must have started in the smaller set. The ﬁrst time
x’s  pointer  is  updated,  therefore,  the  resulting  set  must  have  at  least  2
members. Similarly, the next time x’s pointer is updated, the resulting set
must have had at least 4 members. Continuing on, for any k ≤ n, after x’s
pointer has been updated ⌈lg k⌉ times, the resulting set must have at least
k  members.  Since  the  largest  set  has  at  most  n  members,  each  object’s
pointer is updated at most ⌈lg n⌉ times over all the UNION operations.
Thus  the  total  time  spent  updating  object  pointers  over  all  UNION
operations  is  O(n  lg  n).  We  must  also  account  for  updating  the  tail
pointers  and  the  list  lengths,  which  take  only  Θ(1)  time  per  UNION
operation. The total time spent in all UNION operations is thus O(n lg
n).

The  time  for  the  entire  sequence  of  m  operations  follows.  Each
MAKE-SET  and  FIND-SET  operation  takes  O(1)  time,  and  there  are
O(m) of them. The total time for the entire sequence is thus O(m + n lg
n).

19.2-5
Professor  Gompers  suspects  that  it  might  be  possible  to  keep  just  one
pointer in each set object, rather than two (head and tail), while keeping
the  number  of  pointers  in  each  list  element  at  two.  Show  that  the
professor’s suspicion is well founded by describing how to represent each
set by a linked list such that each operation has the same running time as
the  operations  described  in  this  section.  Describe  also  how  the
operations  work.  Your  scheme  should  allow  for  the  weighted-union
heuristic, with the same effect as described in this section. (Hint: Use the
tail of a linked list as its set’s representative.)

19.2-6
Suggest  a  simple  change  to  the  UNION  procedure  for  the  linked-list
representation that removes the need to keep the tail pointer to the last
object in each list. Regardless of whether the weighted-union heuristic is
used, your change should not change the asymptotic running time of the
UNION  procedure.  (Hint:  Rather  than  appending  one  list  to  another,
splice them together.)

19.3    Disjoint-set forests

A  faster  implementation  of  disjoint  sets  represents  sets  by  rooted  trees,
with  each  node  containing  one  member  and  each  tree  representing  one
set.  In  a  disjoint-set  forest,  illustrated  in  Figure  19.4(a),  each  member
points  only  to  its  parent.  The  root  of  each  tree  contains  the
representative  and  is  its  own  parent.  As  we’ll  see,  although  the
straightforward algorithms that use this representation are no faster than
ones  that  use  the  linked-list  representation,  two  heuristics—“union  by
rank”  and  “path  compression”—yield  an  asymptotically  optimal
disjoint-set data structure.

The  three  disjoint-set  operations  have  simple  implementations.  A
MAKE-SET  operation  simply  creates  a  tree  with  just  one  node.  A
FIND-SET operation follows parent pointers until it reaches the root of
the tree. The nodes visited on this simple path toward the root constitute
the  ﬁnd  path.  A  UNION  operation,  shown  in  Figure  19.4(b),  simply
causes the root of one tree to point to the root of the other.

Figure 19.4 A disjoint-set forest. (a) Trees representing the two sets of Figure 19.2. The tree on
the  left  represents  the  set  {b,  c,  e,  h},  with  c  as  the  representative,  and  the  tree  on  the  right
represents the set {d, f, g}, with f as the representative. (b) The result of UNION (e, g).

Heuristics to improve the running time

So  far,  disjoint-set  forests  have  not  improved  on  the  linked-list
implementation. A sequence of n − 1 UNION operations could create a
tree  that  is  just  a  linear  chain  of  n  nodes.  By  using  two  heuristics,
however, we can achieve a running time that is almost linear in the total
number m of operations.

The  ﬁrst  heuristic,  union  by  rank,  is  similar  to  the  weighted-union
heuristic we used with the linked-list representation. The common-sense
approach  is  to  make  the  root  of  the  tree  with  fewer  nodes  point  to  the
root of the tree with more nodes. Rather than explicitly keeping track of
the  size  of  the  subtree  rooted  at  each  node,  however,  we’ll  adopt  an
approach that eases the analysis. For each node, maintain a rank, which
is an upper bound on the height of the node. Union by rank makes the
root  with  smaller  rank  point  to  the  root  with  larger  rank  during  a
UNION operation.

The  second  heuristic,  path  compression,  is  also  quite  simple  and
highly effective. As shown in Figure 19.5, FIND-SET operations use it to
make  each  node  on  the  ﬁnd  path  point  directly  to  the  root.  Path
compression does not change any ranks.

Pseudocode for disjoint-set forests

The union-by-rank heuristic requires its implementation to keep track of
ranks. With each node x, maintain the integer value x.rank, which is an
upper  bound  on  the  height  of  x  (the  number  of  edges  in  the  longest
simple  path  from  a  descendant  leaf  to  x).  When  MAKE-SET  creates  a
singleton set, the single node in the corresponding tree has an initial rank
of  0.  Each  FIND-SET  operation  leaves  all  ranks  unchanged.  The
UNION operation has two cases, depending on whether the roots of the
trees  have  equal  rank.  If  the  roots  have  unequal  ranks,  make  the  root
with  higher  rank  the  parent  of  the  root  with  lower  rank,  but  don’t
change  the  ranks  themselves.  If  the  roots  have  equal  ranks,  arbitrarily
choose one of the roots as the parent and increment its rank.

Figure  19.5  Path  compression  during  the  operation  FIND-SET.  Arrows  and  self-loops  at  roots
are  omitted.  (a)  A  tree  representing  a  set  prior  to  executing  FIND-SET(a).  Triangles  represent
subtrees whose roots are the nodes shown. Each node has a pointer to its parent. (b) The same set
after executing FIND-SET(a). Each node on the ﬁnd path now points directly to the root.

Let’s  put  this  method  into  pseudocode,  appearing  on  the  next  page.
The  parent  of  node  x  is  denoted  by  x.p.  The  LINK  procedure,  a
subroutine called by UNION, takes pointers to two roots as inputs. The
FIND-SET  procedure  with  path  compression,  implemented  recursively,
turns out to be quite simple.

The  FIND-SET  procedure  is  a  two-pass  method:  as  it  recurses,  it
makes  one  pass  up  the  ﬁnd  path  to  ﬁnd  the  root,  and  as  the  recursion
unwinds, it makes a second pass back down the ﬁnd path to update each
node to point directly to the root. Each call of FIND-SET(x) returns x.p
in line 3. If x is the root, then FIND-SET skips line 2 and just returns
x.p, which is x. In this case the recursion bottoms out. Otherwise, line 2
executes,  and  the  recursive  call  with  parameter  x.p  returns  a  pointer  to
the root. Line 2 updates node x to point directly to the root, and line 3
returns this pointer.

Effect of the heuristics on the running time

Separately,  either  union  by  rank  or  path  compression  improves  the
running time of the operations on disjoint-set forests, and combining the
two heuristics yields an even greater improvement. Alone, union by rank
yields a running time of O(m lg n) for a sequence of m operations, n of
which are MAKE-SET (see Exercise 19.4-4), and this bound is tight (see

Exercise  19.3-3).  Although  we  won’t  prove  it  here,  for  a  sequence  of  n
MAKE-SET  operations  (and  hence  at  most  n  −  1  UNION  operations)
and f FIND-SET operations, the worst-case running time using only the
path-compression heuristic is Θ(n + f · (1 + log2+f/nn)).

Combining  union  by  rank  and  path  compression  gives  a  worst-case
running time of O(m α(n)), where α(n) is a very slowly growing function,
deﬁned  in  Section  19.4.  In  any  conceivable  application  of  a  disjoint-set
data structure, α(n) ≤ 4, and thus, its running time is as good as linear in
m  for  all  practical  purposes.  Mathematically  speaking,  however,  it  is
superlinear. Section 19.4 proves this O(mα(n)) upper bound.

see just how slowly it grows. Then we’ll analyze the running time using
the potential method of amortized analysis.

how quickly this function grows, we ﬁrst obtain closed-form expressions
for A1(j) and A2(j).

Now we can see how quickly Ak(j) grows by simply examining Ak(1)
for  levels  k  =  0,  1,  2,  3,  4.  From  the  deﬁnition  of  A0(j)  and  the  above
lemmas, we have A0(1) = 1 + 1 = 2, A1(1) = 2 · 1 + 1 = 3, and A2(1) =
21+1 · (1 + 1) − 1 = 7. We also have

A3(1) =

which is the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe. (The
symbol “≫” denotes the “much-greater-than” relation.)

We deﬁne the inverse of the function Ak(n), for integer n ≥ 0, by

In words, α(n) is the lowest level k for which Ak(1) is at least n. From the
above values of Ak(1), we see that

It  is  only  for  values  of  n  so  large  that  the  term  “astronomical”
understates them (greater than A4(1), a huge number) that α(n) > 4, and
so α(n) ≤ 4 for all practical purposes.

Properties of ranks

In  the  remainder  of  this  section,  we  prove  an  O(mα(n))  bound  on  the
running time of the disjoint-set operations with union by rank and path

compression.  In  order  to  prove  this  bound,  we  ﬁrst  prove  some  simple
properties of ranks.

Lemma 19.4
For  all  nodes  x,  we  have  x.rank  ≤  x.p.rank,  with  strict  inequality  if  x  ≠
x.p (x is not a root). The value of x.rank is initially 0, increases through
time until x ≠ x.p, and from then on, x.rank does not change. The value
of x.p.rank monotonically increases over time.

Proof      The  proof  is  a  straightforward  induction  on  the  number  of
operations,  using  the  implementations  of  MAKE-SET,  UNION,  and
FIND-SET that appear on page 530, and is left as Exercise 19.4-1.

▪

Corollary 19.5
On the simple path from any node going up toward a root, node ranks
strictly increase.

▪

Lemma 19.6
Every node has rank at most n − 1.

Proof      Each  node’s  rank  starts  at  0,  and  it  increases  only  upon  LINK
operations.  Because  there  are  at  most  n  −  1  UNION  operations,  there
are also at most n − 1 LINK operations. Because each LINK operation
either leaves all ranks alone or increases some node’s rank by 1, all ranks
are at most n − 1.

▪

Lemma 19.6 provides a weak bound on ranks. In fact, every node has
rank  at  most  ⌊lg  n⌋  (see  Exercise  19.4-2).  The  looser  bound  of  Lemma
19.6 sufﬁces for our purposes, however.

Proving the time bound

In  order  to  prove  the  O(mα(n))  time  bound,  we’ll  use  the  potential
method  of  amortized  analysis  from  Section  16.3.  In  performing  the
amortized  analysis,  it  will  be  convenient  to  assume  that  we  invoke  the

LINK  operation  rather  than  the  UNION  operation.  That  is,  since  the
parameters of the LINK procedure are pointers to two roots, we act as
though  we  perform  the  appropriate  FIND-SET  operations  separately.
The following lemma shows that even if we count the extra FIND-SET
operations  induced  by  UNION  calls,  the  asymptotic  running  time
remains unchanged.

Lemma 19.7
Suppose that we convert a sequence S′ of m′ MAKE-SET, UNION, and
FIND-SET operations into a sequence S of m MAKE-SET, LINK, and
FIND-SET  operations  by  turning  each  UNION  into  two  FIND-SET
operations followed by one LINK. Then, if sequence S runs in O(mα(n))
time, sequence S′ runs in O(m′ α(n)) time.

Proof      Since  each  UNION  operation  in  sequence  S′  is  converted  into
three operations in S, we have m′ ≤ m ≤ 3m′, so that m = Θ(m′), Thus, an
O(m α(n)) time bound for the converted sequence S implies an O(m′ α(n))
time bound for the original sequence S′.

▪

From now on, we assume that the initial sequence of m′ MAKE-SET,
UNION,  and  FIND-SET  operations  has  been  converted  to  a  sequence
of m MAKE-SET, LINK, and FIND-SET operations. We now prove an
O(m α(n)) time bound for the converted sequence and appeal to Lemma
19.7 to prove the O(m′ α(n)) running time of the original sequence of m′
operations.

Potential function

The potential function we use assigns a potential ϕq(x) to each node x in
the  disjoint-set  forest  after  q  operations.  For  the  potential  Φq  of  the
entire  forest  after  q  operations,  sum  the  individual  node  potentials:
. Because the forest is empty before the ﬁrst operation, the
sum is taken over an empty set, and so Φ0 = 0. No potential Φq is ever
negative.

The value of ϕq(x) depends on whether x is a tree root after the qth

operation. If it is, or if x.rank = 0, then ϕq(x) = α(n) · x.rank.

Now  suppose  that  after  the  qth  operation,  x  is  not  a  root  and  that
x.rank ≥ 1. We need to deﬁne two auxiliary functions on x before we can
deﬁne ϕq(x). First we deﬁne

That is, level(x) is the greatest level k for which Ak, applied to x’s rank, is
no greater than x’s parent’s rank.

We claim that

which we see as follows. We have

x.p.rank ≥ x.rank + 1 (by Lemma 19.4 because x is not a root)
= A0(x.rank) (by the deﬁnition (19.1) of A0(j)),

which implies that level(x) ≥ 0, and

Aα(n)(x.rank) ≥ Aα(n)(1) (because Ak(j) is strictly increasing)

≥ n
> x.p.rank (by Lemma 19.6),

(by the deﬁnition (19.2) of α(n))

which implies that level(x) < α(n).

For  a  given  nonroot  node  x,  the  value  of  level(x)  monotonically
increases  over  time.  Why?  Because  x  is  not  a  root,  its  rank  does  not
change. The rank of x.p monotonically increases over time, since if x.p is
not a root then its rank does not change, and if x.p is a root then its rank
can  never  decrease.  Thus,  the  difference  between  x.rank  and  x.p.rank
monotonically increases over time. Therefore, the value of k needed for
Ak(x.rank)  to  overtake  x.p.rank  monotonically  increases  over  time  as
well.

The second auxiliary function applies when x.rank ≥ 1: iter(x) = max

That  is,  iter(x)  is  the  largest  number  of  times  we  can  iteratively  apply
Alevel(x), applied initially to x’s rank, before exceeding x’s parent’s rank.

We claim that when x.rank ≥ 1, we have

which we see as follows. We have

x.p.rank ≥ Alevel(x)
(x.rank)

=

(by the deﬁnition (19.3) of level(x))

(by  the  deﬁnition  (3.30)  of  functional
iteration),

which implies that iter(x) ≥ 1. We also have

= Alevel(x)+1(x.rank) (by the deﬁnition (19.1) of Ak(j))

> x.p.rank

the  deﬁnition

(by
level(x)),

(19.3)  of

which  implies  that  iter(x)  ≤  x.rank.  Note  that  because  x.p.rank
monotonically  increases  over  time,  in  order  for  iter(x)  to  decrease,
level(x)  must  increase.  As  long  as  level(x)  remains  unchanged,  iter(x)
must either increase or remain unchanged.

With  these  auxiliary  functions  in  place,  we  are  ready  to  deﬁne  the

potential of node x after q operations:

We next investigate some useful properties of node potentials.

Lemma 19.8
For every node x, and for all operation counts q, we have

0 ≤ ϕq(x) ≤ α(n) · x.rank.

Proof      If  x  is  a  root  or  x.rank  =  0,  then  ϕq(x)  =  α(n)  ·  x.rank  by
deﬁnition. Now suppose that x is not a root and that x.rank ≥ 1. We can
obtain a lower bound on ϕq(x) by maximizing level(x) and iter(x). The
bounds  (19.4)  and  (19.6)  give  α(n)  −  level(x)  ≥  1  and  iter(x)  ≤  x.rank.
Thus, we have

ϕq(x) = (α(n) − level(x)) · x.rank − iter(x)

≥ x.rank − x.rank
= 0.

Similarly,  minimizing  level(x)  and  iter(x)  provides  an  upper  bound  on
ϕq(x). By the bound (19.4), level(x) ≥ 0, and by the bound (19.6), iter(x)
≥ 1. Thus, we have

ϕq(x) ≤ (α(n) − 0) · x.rank − 1
= α(n) · x.rank − 1
< α(n) · x.rank.

▪

Corollary 19.9
If node x is not a root and x.rank > 0, then ϕq(x) < α(n) · x.rank.

Potential changes and amortized costs of operations

We are now ready to examine how the disjoint-set operations affect node
potentials.  Once  we  understand  how  each  operation  can  change  the
potential, we can determine the amortized costs.

Lemma 19.10
Let x be a node that is not a root, and suppose that the qth operation is
either  a  LINK  or  a  FIND-SET.  Then  after  the  qth  operation,  ϕq(x)  ≤
ϕq−1(x).  Moreover,  if  x.rank  ≥  1  and  either  level(x)  or  iter(x)  changes
due to the qth operation, then ϕq(x) ≤ ϕq−1(x) − 1. That is, x’s potential

cannot increase, and if it has positive rank and either level(x) or iter(x)
changes, then x’s potential drops by at least 1.

Proof   Because x is not a root, the qth operation does not change x.rank,
and  because  n  does  not  change  after  the  initial  n  MAKE-SET
operations, α(n) remains unchanged as well. Hence, these components of
the formula for x’s potential remain the same after the qth operation. If
x.rank = 0, then ϕq(x) = ϕq−1(x) = 0.

Now  assume  that  x.rank  ≥  1.  Recall  that  level(x)  monotonically
increases over time. If the qth operation leaves level(x) unchanged, then
iter(x) either increases or remains unchanged. If both level(x) and iter(x)
are  unchanged,  then  ϕq(x)  =  ϕq−1(x).  If  level(x)  is  unchanged  and
iter(x) increases, then it increases by at least 1, and so ϕq(x) ≤ ϕq−1(x) −
1.

Finally, if the qth operation increases level(x), it increases by at least
1, so that the value of the term (α(n) − level(x)) · x.rank drops by at least
x.rank.  Because  level(x)  increased,  the  value  of  iter(x)  might  drop,  but
according to the bound (19.6), the drop is by at most x.rank − 1. Thus,
the  increase  in  potential  due  to  the  change  in  iter(x)  is  less  than  the
decrease  in  potential  due  to  the  change  in  level(x),  yielding  ϕq(x)  ≤
ϕq−1(x) − 1.

▪

Our ﬁnal three lemmas show that the amortized cost of each MAKE-
SET, LINK, and FIND-SET operation is O(α(n)). Recall from equation
(16.2) on page 456 that the amortized cost of each operation is its actual
cost plus the change in potential due to the operation.

Lemma 19.11
The amortized cost of each MAKE-SET operation is O(1).

Proof   Suppose that the qth operation is MAKE-SET(x). This operation
creates  node  x  with  rank  0,  so  that  ϕq(x)  =  0.  No  other  ranks  or
potentials change, and so Φq = Φq−1. Noting that the actual cost of the
MAKE-SET operation is O(1) completes the proof.

▪

Lemma 19.12
The amortized cost of each LINK operation is O(α(n)).

Proof   Suppose that the qth operation is LINK(x, y). The actual cost of
the LINK operation is O(1). Without loss of generality, suppose that the
LINK makes y the parent of x.

To determine the change in potential due to the LINK, note that the
only nodes whose potentials may change are x, y, and the children of y
just  prior  to  the  operation.  We’ll  show  that  the  only  node  whose
potential  can  increase  due  to  the  LINK  is  y,  and  that  its  increase  is  at
most α(n):

By Lemma 19.10, any node that is y’s child just before the LINK
cannot have its potential increase due to the LINK.

From the deﬁnition (19.7) of ϕq(x), note that, since x was a root
just before the qth operation, ϕq−1(x) = α(n) · x.rank at that time.
If x.rank = 0, then ϕq(x) = ϕq−1(x) = 0. Otherwise,

ϕq(x) < α(n) · x.rank (by Corollary 19.9)

= ϕq−1(x),

and so x’s potential decreases.

Because  y  is  a  root  prior  to  the  LINK,  ϕq−1(y)  =  α(n)  ·  y.rank.
After the LINK operation, y remains a root, so that y’s potential
still  equals  α(n)  times  its  rank  after  the  operation.  The  LINK
operation  either  leaves  y’s  rank  alone  or  increases  y’s  rank  by  1.
Therefore, either ϕq(y) = ϕq−1(y) or ϕq(y) = ϕq−1(y) + α(n).

The increase in potential due to the LINK operation, therefore, is at
most α(n). The amortized cost of the LINK operation is O(1) + α(n) =
O(α(n)).

▪

Lemma 19.13
The amortized cost of each FIND-SET operation is O(α(n)).

Proof   Suppose that the qth operation is a FIND-SET and that the ﬁnd
path  contains  s  nodes.  The  actual  cost  of  the  FIND-SET  operation  is
O(s). We will show that no node’s potential increases due to the FIND-
SET and that at least max {0, s − (α(n) + 2)} nodes on the ﬁnd path have
their potential decrease by at least 1.

We ﬁrst show that no node’s potential increases. Lemma 19.10 takes
care of all nodes other than the root. If x is the root, then its potential is
α(n) · x.rank, which does not change due to the FIND-SET operation.

Now  we  show  that  at  least  max  {0,  s  −  (α(n)  +  2)}  nodes  have  their
potential  decrease  by  at  least  1.  Let  x  be  a  node  on  the  ﬁnd  path  such
that x.rank > 0 and x is followed somewhere on the ﬁnd path by another
node y that is not a root, where level(y) = level(x) just before the FIND-
SET operation. (Node y need not immediately follow x on the ﬁnd path.)
All but at most α(n) + 2 nodes on the ﬁnd path satisfy these constraints
on x. Those that do not satisfy them are the ﬁrst node on the ﬁnd path
(if it has rank 0), the last node on the path (i.e., the root), and the last
node w on the path for which level(w) = k, for each k = 0, 1, 2, … , α(n)
−1.

Consider  such  a  node  x.  It  has  positive  rank  and  is  followed
somewhere  on  the  ﬁnd  path  by  nonroot  node  y  such  that  level(y)  =
level(x)  before  the  path  compression  occurs.  We  claim  that  the  path
compression decreases x’s potential by at least 1. To prove this claim, let
k = level(x) = level(y) and i = iter(x) before the path compression occurs.
Just prior to the path compression caused by the FIND-SET, we have

x.p.rank ≥

(by the deﬁnition (19.5) of iter(x)),

y.p.rank ≥ Ak(y.rank) (by the deﬁnition (19.3) of level(y)),

y.rank ≥ x.p.rank

(by Corollary 19.5 and because y follows x on the

ﬁnd path).

Putting these inequalities together gives

y.p.rank ≥ Ak(y.rank)

≥ Ak(x.p.rank) (because Ak(j) is strictly increasing)
≥

=

(by the deﬁnition (3.30) of functional iteration).

Because path compression makes x and y have the same parent, after
path  compression  we  have  x.p.rank  =  y.p.rank.  The  parent  of  y  might
change due to the path compression, but if it does, the rank of y’s new
parent compared with the rank of y’s parent before path compression is
same  or  greater.  Since  x.rank  does  not  change,
either

deﬁnition (19.5) of the iter function, the value of iter(x) increases from i
to  at  least  i  +  1.  By  Lemma  19.10,  ϕq(x)  ≤  ϕq−1(x)  −  1,  so  that  x’s
potential decreases by at least 1.

  after  path  compression.  By

The  amortized  cost  of  the  FIND-SET  operation  is  the  actual  cost
plus the change in potential. The actual cost is O(s), and we have shown
that the total potential decreases by at least max {0, s − (α(n) + 2)}. The
amortized cost, therefore, is at most O(s) − (s − (α(n) + 2)) = O(s) − s +
O(α(n))  =  O(α(n)),  since  we  can  scale  up  the  units  of  potential  to
dominate the constant hidden in O(s). (See Exercise 19.4-6.)

The  proof  of  Lemma  19.13  ends  with  scaling  the  units  of  potential  to
dominate the constant hidden in the O(s) term. To be more precise in the
proof, you need to change the deﬁnition (19.7) of the potential function

constant in the O(s) term. How must the rest of the analysis change to
accommodate this updated potential function?

Problems

19-1     Ofﬂine minimum

In  the  ofﬂine  minimum  problem,  you  maintain  a  dynamic  set  T  of
elements  from  the  domain  {1,  2,  …  ,  n}  under  the  operations  INSERT
and  EXTRACT-MIN.  The  input  is  a  sequence  S  of  n  INSERT  and  m
EXTRACT-MIN calls, where each key in {1, 2, … , n} is inserted exactly
once.  Your  goal  is  to  determine  which  key  is  returned  by  each
EXTRACT-MIN call. Speciﬁcally, you must ﬁll in an array extracted[1:
m], where for i = 1, 2, … , m, extracted[i] is the key returned by the ith
EXTRACT-MIN call. The problem is “ofﬂine” in the sense that you are
allowed  to  process  the  entire  sequence  S  before  determining  any  of  the
returned keys.

a. Consider the following instance of the ofﬂine minimum problem, in
which each operation INSERT(i) is represented by the value of i and
each EXTRACT-MIN is represented by the letter E:

4, 8, E, 3, E, 9, 2, 6, E, E, E, 1, 7, E, 5.

Fill in the correct values in the extracted array.

To  develop  an  algorithm  for  this  problem,  break  the  sequence  S  into
homogeneous subsequences. That is, represent S by

I1, E, I2, E, I3, … , Im, E, Im+1,

where  each  E  represents  a  single  EXTRACT-MIN  call  and  each  Ij
represents  a  (possibly  empty)  sequence  of  INSERT  calls.  For  each
subsequence Ij, initially place the keys inserted by these operations into a
set  Kj,  which  is  empty  if  Ij  is  empty.  Then  execute  the  OFFLINE-

c. Describe how to implement OFFLINE-MINIMUM efﬁciently with a

worst-case running time of your implementation.

19-2     Depth determination
In  the  depth-determination  problem,  you  maintain  a  forest  ℱ  =  {Ti}  of
rooted trees under three operations:

MAKE-TREE(v) creates a tree whose only node is v.

FIND-DEPTH(v) returns the depth of node v within its tree.

GRAFT(r,  v)  makes  node  r,  which  is  assumed  to  be  the  root  of  a  tree,
become the child of node v, which is assumed to be in a different tree
from r but may or may not itself be a root.

a. Suppose that you use a tree representation similar to a disjoint-set
forest: v.p is the parent of node v, except that v.p = v if v is a root.
Suppose further that you implement GRAFT(r, v) by setting r.p = v
and FIND-DEPTH(v) by following the ﬁnd path from v up to the root,
returning a count of all nodes other than v encountered. Show that the
worst-case running time of a sequence of m MAKE-TREE, FIND-
DEPTH, and GRAFT operations is Θ(m2).

By  using  the  union-by-rank  and  path-compression  heuristics,  you  can
reduce the worst-case running time. Use the disjoint-set forest S = {Si},
where each set Si (which is itself a tree) corresponds to a tree Ti in the
forest ℱ. The tree structure within a set Si, however, does not necessarily
correspond  to  that  of  Ti.  In  fact,  the  implementation  of  Si  does  not
record the exact parent-child relationships but nevertheless allows you to
determine any node’s depth in Ti.

The  key  idea  is  to  maintain  in  each  node  v  a  “pseudodistance”  v.d,
which is deﬁned so that the sum of the pseudodistances along the simple
path from v to the root of its set Si equals the depth of v in Ti. That is, if
the simple path from v to its root in Si is v0, v1, … , vk, where v0 = v and

vk is Si’s root, then the depth of v in Ti is

.

b. Give an implementation of MAKE-TREE.

c. Show how to modify FIND-SET to implement FIND-DEPTH. Your
implementation should perform path compression, and its running
time should be linear in the length of the ﬁnd path. Make sure that
your implementation updates pseudodistances correctly.

d. Show how to implement GRAFT(r, v), which combines the sets

containing r and v, by modifying the UNION and LINK procedures.
Make sure that your implementation updates pseudodistances
correctly. Note that the root of a set Si is not necessarily the root of
the corresponding tree Ti.

e. Give a tight bound on the worst-case running time of a sequence of m
MAKE-TREE, FIND-DEPTH, and GRAFT operations, n of which
are MAKE-TREE operations.

19-3     Tarjan’s ofﬂine lowest-common-ancestors algorithm
The lowest common ancestor of two nodes u and v in a rooted tree T is
the node w that is an ancestor of both u and v and that has the greatest
depth in T. In the ofﬂine lowest-common-ancestors problem, you are given
a rooted tree T and an arbitrary set P = {{u, v}} of unordered pairs of
nodes  in  T,  and  you  wish  to  determine  the  lowest  common  ancestor  of
each pair in P.

To  solve  the  ofﬂine  lowest-common-ancestors  problem,  the  LCA
procedure  on  the  following  page  performs  a  tree  walk  of  T  with  the
initial call LCA(T.root). Assume that each node is colored WHITE prior
to the walk.

a. Argue that line 10 executes exactly once for each pair {u, v} ∈ P.

b. Argue that at the time of the call LCA(u), the number of sets in the

disjoint-set data structure equals the depth of u in T.

LCA(u)
  1 MAKE-SET(u)
  2 FIND-SET(u).ancestor = u
  3 for each child v of u in T
LCA(v)
  4
  5 UNION(u, v)
  6
  7 u.color = BLACK
  8 for each node v such that {u, v} ∈ P
  9

FIND-SET(u).ancestor = u

if v.color == BLACK

10

print “The lowest common ancestor of ”
u “and” v “is” FIND-SET(v).ancestor

c. Prove that LCA correctly prints the lowest common ancestor of u and

v for each pair {u, v} ∈ P.

d. Analyze the running time of LCA, assuming that you use the

implementation of the disjoint-set data structure in Section 19.3.

Chapter notes

Many of the important results for disjoint-set data structures are due at
least in part to R. E. Tarjan. Using aggregate analysis, Tarjan [427, 429]
gave  the  ﬁrst  tight  upper  bound  in  terms  of  the  very  slowly  growing
  of  Ackermann’s  function.  (The  function  Ak(j)  given  in
inverse
Section 19.4 is similar to Ackermann’s function, and the function α(n) is
similar to
 are at most 4 for all conceivable
values of m and n.) An upper bound of O(m lg* n) was proven earlier by
Hopcroft and Ullman [5, 227]. The treatment in Section 19.4 is adapted
from  a  later  analysis  by  Tarjan  [431],  which  is  based  on  an  analysis  by
Kozen [270]. Harfst and Reingold [209] give a potential-based version of
Tarjan’s earlier bound.

. Both α(n) and

Tarjan  and  van  Leeuwen  [432]  discuss  variants  on  the  path-
compression  heuristic,  including  “one-pass  methods,”  which  sometimes
offer  better  constant  factors  in  their  performance  than  do  two-pass
methods. As with Tarjan’s earlier analyses of the basic path-compression
heuristic, the analyses by Tarjan and van Leeuwen are aggregate. Harfst
and  Reingold  [209]  later  showed  how  to  make  a  small  change  to  the
potential function to adapt their path-compression analysis to these one-
pass  variants.  Goel  et  al.  [182]  prove  that  linking  disjoint-set  trees
randomly  yields  the  same  asymptotic  running  time  as  union  by  rank.
Gabow  and  Tarjan  [166]  show  that  in  certain  applications,  the  disjoint-
set operations can be made to run in O(m) time.

Tarjan  [428]  showed  that  a  lower  bound  of

  time  is
required  for  operations  on  any  disjoint-set  data  structure  satisfying
certain  technical  conditions.  This  lower  bound  was  later  generalized  by
in  the  worst  case,
[155],  who  showed  that
Fredman  and  Saks

 (lg n)-bit words of memory must be accessed.
