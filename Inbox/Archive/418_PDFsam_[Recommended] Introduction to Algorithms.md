12        Binary Search Trees

The  search  tree  data  structure  supports  each  of  the  dynamic-set
operations  listed  on  page  250:  SEARCH,  MINIMUM,  MAXIMUM,
PREDECESSOR,  SUCCESSOR,  INSERT,  and  DELETE.  Thus,  you
can use a search tree both as a dictionary and as a priority queue.

Basic  operations  on  a  binary  search  tree  take  time  proportional  to
the  height  of  the  tree.  For  a  complete  binary  tree  with  n  nodes,  such
operations run in Θ(lg n) worst-case time. If the tree is a linear chain of
n  nodes,  however,  the  same  operations  take  Θ(n)  worst-case  time.  In
Chapter 13, we’ll see a variation of binary search trees, red-black trees,
whose operations guarantee a height of O(lg n). We won’t prove it here,
but  if  you  build  a  binary  search  tree  on  a  random  set  of  n  keys,  its
expected height is O(lg n) even if you don’t try to limit its height.

After  presenting  the  basic  properties  of  binary  search  trees,  the
following  sections  show  how  to  walk  a  binary  search  tree  to  print  its
values in sorted order, how to search for a value in a binary search tree,
how  to  ﬁnd  the  minimum  or  maximum  element,  how  to  ﬁnd  the
predecessor or successor of an element, and how to insert into or delete
from  a  binary  search  tree.  The  basic  mathematical  properties  of  trees
appear in Appendix B.

12.1    What is a binary search tree?

A binary search tree is organized, as the name suggests, in a binary tree,
as  shown  in  Figure  12.1.  You  can  represent  such  a  tree  with  a  linked

data structure, as in Section 10.3. In addition to a key and satellite data,
each node object contains attributes left, right, and p that point to the
nodes  corresponding  to  its  left  child,  its  right  child,  and  its  parent,
respectively. If a child or the parent is missing, the appropriate attribute
contains the value NIL. The tree itself has an attribute root that points
to the root node, or NIL if the tree is empty. The root node T.root is the
only node in a tree T whose parent is NIL.

Figure  12.1  Binary  search  trees.  For  any  node  x,  the  keys  in  the  left  subtree  of  x  are  at  most
x.key, and the keys in the right subtree of x are at least x.key. Different binary search trees can
represent the same set of values. The worst-case running time for most search-tree operations is
proportional to the height of the tree. (a) A binary search tree on 6 nodes with height 2. The top
ﬁgure shows how to view the tree conceptually, and the bottom ﬁgure shows the left, right, and p
attributes in each node, in the style of Figure 10.6 on page 266. (b) A less efﬁcient binary search
tree, with height 4, that contains the same keys.

The keys in a binary search tree are always stored in such a way as to

satisfy the binary-search-tree property:

Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left
subtree  of  x,  then  y.key  ≤  x.key.  If  y  is  a  node  in  the  right
subtree of x, then y.key ≥ x.key.

Thus, in Figure 12.1(a), the key of the root is 6, the keys 2, 5, and 5
in its left subtree are no larger than 6, and the keys 7 and 8 in its right
subtree are no smaller than 6. The same property holds for every node
in the tree. For example, looking at the root’s left child as the root of a
subtree, this subtree root has the key 5, the key 2 in its left subtree is no
larger than 5, and the key 5 in its right subtree is no smaller than 5.

Because of the binary-search-tree property, you can print out all the
keys  in  a  binary  search  tree  in  sorted  order  by  a  simple  recursive
algorithm,  called  an  inorder  tree  walk,  given  by  the  procedure
INORDER-TREE-WALK.  This  algorithm  is  so  named  because  it
prints the key of the root of a subtree between printing the values in its
left subtree and printing those in its right subtree. (Similarly, a preorder
tree  walk  prints  the  root  before  the  values  in  either  subtree,  and  a
postorder  tree  walk  prints  the  root  after  the  values  in  its  subtrees.)  To
print all the elements in a binary search tree T, call INORDER-TREE-
WALK(T.root).  For  example,  the  inorder  tree  walk  prints  the  keys  in
each of the two binary search trees from Figure 12.1 in the order 2, 5, 5,
6,  7,  8.  The  correctness  of  the  algorithm  follows  by  induction  directly
from the binary-search-tree property.

It  takes  Θ(n)  time  to  walk  an  n-node  binary  search  tree,  since  after
the  initial  call,  the  procedure  calls  itself  recursively  exactly  twice  for
each node in the tree—once for its left child and once for its right child.
The following theorem gives a formal proof that it takes linear time to
perform an inorder tree walk.

Theorem 12.1
If x is the root of an n-node subtree, then the call INORDER-TREE-
WALK(x) takes Θ(n) time.

Proof      Let  T(n)  denote  the  time  taken  by  INORDER-TREE-WALK
when  it  is  called  on  the  root  of  an  n-node  subtree.  Since  INORDER-
TREE-WALK visits all n nodes of the subtree, we have T(n) = Ω(n). It
remains to show that T(n) = O(n).

Since INORDER-TREE-WALK takes a small, constant amount of
time  on  an  empty  subtree  (for  the  test  x  ≠  NIL),  we  have  T(0)  =  c  for
some constant c > 0.

For  n  >  0,  suppose  that  INORDER-TREE-WALK  is  called  on  a
node x whose left subtree has k nodes and whose right subtree has n − k
−  1  nodes.  The  time  to  perform  INORDER-TREE-WALK(x)  is
bounded by T(n) ≤ T(k) + T(n − k − 1) + d for some constant d > 0 that
reﬂects an upper bound on the time to execute the body of INORDER-
TREE-WALK(x), exclusive of the time spent in recursive calls.

We use the substitution method to show that T(n) = O(n) by proving
that T(n) ≤ (c + d)n + c. For n = 0, we have (c + d) · 0 + c = c = T(0). For
n > 0, we have

T(n) ≤ T(k) + T(n − k − 1) + d

≤ ((c + d)k + c) + ((c + d)(n − k − 1) + c) + d

= (c + d)n + c − (c + d) + c + d
= (c + d)n + c,

which completes the proof.

takes Ω(n lg n) time in the worst case.

12.2    Querying a binary search tree

Binary search trees can support the queries MINIMUM, MAXIMUM,
SUCCESSOR,  and  PREDECESSOR,  as  well  as  SEARCH.  This
section examines these operations and shows how to support each one
in O(h) time on any binary search tree of height h.

Searching

To  search  for  a  node  with  a  given  key  in  a  binary  search  tree,  call  the
TREE-SEARCH procedure. Given a pointer x to the root of a subtree
and a key k, TREE-SEARCH(x, k) returns a pointer to a node with key
k  if  one  exists  in  the  subtree;  otherwise,  it  returns  NIL.  To  search  for
key k in the entire binary search tree T, call TREE-SEARCH(T.root, k).

TREE-SEARCH(x, k)
1 if x == NIL or k == x.key
return x
2
3 if k < x.key
4

return TREE-SEARCH(x.left, k)

5 else return TREE-SEARCH(x.right, k)

ITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH(x, k)
1 while x ≠ NIL and k ≠ x.key
2

if k < x.key
x = x.left
else x = x.right

3

4
5 return x

The  TREE-SEARCH  procedure  begins  its  search  at  the  root  and
traces a simple path downward in the tree, as shown in Figure 12.2(a).
For each node x it encounters, it compares the key k with x.key. If the
two keys are equal, the search terminates. If k is smaller than x.key, the
search  continues  in  the  left  subtree  of  x,  since  the  binary-search-tree
property implies that k cannot reside in the right subtree. Symmetrically,
if  k  is  larger  than  x.key,  the  search  continues  in  the  right  subtree.  The
nodes encountered during the recursion form a simple path downward
from  the  root  of  the  tree,  and  thus  the  running  time  of  TREE-
SEARCH is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

Figure 12.2 Queries on a binary search tree. Nodes and paths followed in each query are colored
blue. (a) A search for the key 13 in the tree follows the path 15 → 6 → 7 → 13 from the root. (b)
The minimum key in the tree is 2, which is found by following left pointers from the root. The
maximum  key  20  is  found  by  following  right  pointers  from  the  root.  (c)  The  successor  of  the
node with key 15 is the node with key 17, since it is the minimum key in the right subtree of 15.
(d) The node with key 13 has no right subtree, and thus its successor is its lowest ancestor whose
left child is also an ancestor. In this case, the node with key 15 is its successor.

Since  the  TREE-SEARCH  procedure  recurses  on  either  the  left
subtree or the right subtree, but not both, we can rewrite the algorithm
to  “unroll”  the  recursion  into  a  while  loop.  On  most  computers,  the
ITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH  procedure  on  the  facing  page  is  more
efﬁcient.

Minimum and maximum

To ﬁnd an element in a binary search tree whose key is a minimum, just
follow  left  child  pointers  from  the  root  until  you  encounter  a  NIL,  as
shown  in  Figure  12.2(b).  The  TREE-MINIMUM  procedure  returns  a
pointer to the minimum element in the subtree rooted at a given node x,
which we assume to be non-NIL.

TREE-MINIMUM(x)
1while x.left ≠ NIL
x = x.left
2
3return x

TREE-MAXIMUM(x)
1while x.right ≠ NIL
x = x.right
2
3return x

The binary-search-tree property guarantees that TREE-MINIMUM
is correct. If node x has no left subtree, then since every key in the right
subtree of x is at least as large as x.key, the minimum key in the subtree
rooted at x is x.key. If node x has a left subtree, then since no key in the
right subtree is smaller than x.key and every key in the left subtree is not
larger than x.key, the minimum key in the subtree rooted at x resides in
the subtree rooted at x.left.

The pseudocode for TREE-MAXIMUM is symmetric. Both TREE-
MINIMUM  and  TREE-MAXIMUM  run  in  O(h)  time  on  a  tree  of
in  TREE-SEARCH,  the  sequence  of  nodes
height  h  since,  as
encountered forms a simple path downward from the root.

Successor and predecessor

Given a node in a binary search tree, how can you ﬁnd its successor in
the  sorted  order  determined  by  an  inorder  tree  walk?  If  all  keys  are
distinct,  the  successor  of  a  node  x  is  the  node  with  the  smallest  key
greater  than  x.key.  Regardless  of  whether  the  keys  are  distinct,  we
deﬁne the successor of a node as the next node visited in an inorder tree
walk. The structure of a binary search tree allows you to determine the

successor of a node without comparing keys. The TREE-SUCCESSOR
procedure  on  the  facing  page  returns  the  successor  of  a  node  x  in  a
binary search tree if it exists, or NIL if x is the last node that would be
visited during an inorder walk.

The  code  for  TREE-SUCCESSOR  has  two  cases.  If  the  right
subtree  of  node  x  is  nonempty,  then  the  successor  of  x  is  just  the
leftmost node in x’s right subtree, which line 2 ﬁnds by calling TREE-
MINIMUM(x.right). For example, the successor of the node with key
15 in Figure 12.2(c) is the node with key 17.

On the other hand, as Exercise 12.2-6 asks you to show, if the right
subtree of node x is empty and x has a successor y, then y is the lowest
ancestor of x whose left child is also an ancestor of x. In Figure 12.2(d),
the successor of the node with key 13 is the node with key 15. To ﬁnd y,
go up the tree from x until you encounter either the root or a node that
is the left child of its parent. Lines 4–8 of TREE-SUCCESSOR handle
this case.

TREE-SUCCESSOR(x)
1 if x.right ≠ NIL
2

return  TREE-MINIMUM(x.right)    //  leftmost  node  in  right

subtree

3 else // ﬁnd the lowest ancestor of x whose left child is an ancestor of

x

4

5

6

7

8

y = x.p
while y ≠ NIL and x == y.right

x = y
y = y.p

return y

The  running  time  of  TREE-SUCCESSOR  on  a  tree  of  height  h  is
O(h), since it either follows a simple path up the tree or follows a simple
path  down  the  tree.  The  procedure  TREE-PREDECESSOR,  which  is
symmetric to TREE-SUCCESSOR, also runs in O(h) time.
In summary, we have proved the following theorem.

Theorem 12.2
The  dynamic-set  operations  SEARCH,  MINIMUM,  MAXIMUM,
SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR can be implemented so that each
one runs in O(h) time on a binary search tree of height h.

search path; B, the keys on the search path; and C, the keys to the right
of the search path. Professor Kilmer claims that any three keys a ∈ A, b

T larger than x.key or the largest key in T smaller than x.key.

12.3    Insertion and deletion

The  operations  of  insertion  and  deletion  cause  the  dynamic  set
represented by a binary search tree to change. The data structure must
be  modiﬁed  to  reﬂect  this  change,  but  in  such  a  way  that  the  binary-
search-tree property continues to hold. We’ll see that modifying the tree
to insert a new element is relatively straightforward, but deleting a node
from a binary search tree is more complicated.

Insertion

The TREE-INSERT procedure inserts a new node into a binary search
tree. The procedure takes a binary search tree T and a node z for which

z.key  has  already  been  ﬁlled  in,  z.left  =  NIL,  and  z.right  =  NIL.  It
modiﬁes  T  and  some  of  the  attributes  of  z  so  as  to  insert  z  into  an
appropriate position in the tree.

  6

  5

TREE-INSERT(T, z)
  1 x = T.root
  2 y = NIL
  3 while x ≠ NIL
y = x
  4
if z.key < x.key
x = x.left
else x = x.right

  7
  8 z.p = y
  9 if y == NIL
T.root = z
10
11 elseif z.key < y.key
y.left = z
12
13 else y.right = z

// node being compared with z
// y will be parent of z
// descend until reaching a leaf

// found the location—insert z with parent y

// tree T was empty

Figure  12.3  shows  how  TREE-INSERT  works.  Just  like  the
procedures  TREE-SEARCH  and
ITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH,
TREE-INSERT begins at the root of the tree and the pointer x traces a
simple path downward looking for a NIL to replace with the input node
z.  The  procedure  maintains  the  trailing  pointer  y  as  the  parent  of  x.
After initialization, the while loop in lines 3–7 causes these two pointers
to move down the tree, going left or right depending on the comparison
of  z.key  with  x.key,  until  x  becomes  NIL.  This  NIL  occupies  the
position where node z will go. More precisely, this NIL is a left or right
attribute of the node that will become z’s parent, or it is T.root if tree T
is currently empty. The procedure needs the trailing pointer y, because
by the time it ﬁnds the NIL where z belongs, the search has proceeded
one step beyond the node that needs to be changed. Lines 8–13 set the
pointers that cause z to be inserted.

Figure 12.3 Inserting a node with key 13 into a binary search tree. The simple path from the root
down to the position where the node is inserted is shown in blue. The new node and the link to
its parent are highlighted in orange.

Like  the  other  primitive  operations  on  search  trees,  the  procedure

TREE-INSERT runs in O(h) time on a tree of height h.

Deletion

The  overall  strategy  for  deleting  a  node  z  from  a  binary  search  tree  T
has three basic cases and, as we’ll see, one of the cases is a bit tricky.

If z has no children, then simply remove it by modifying its parent
to replace z with NIL as its child.

If z has just one child, then elevate that child to take z’s position
in the tree by modifying z’s parent to replace z by z’s child.

If z has two children, ﬁnd z’s successor y—which must belong to
z’s right subtree—and move y to take z’s position in the tree. The
rest  of  z’s  original  right  subtree  becomes  y’s  new  right  subtree,
and  z’s  left  subtree  becomes  y’s  new  left  subtree.  Because  y  is  z’s
successor,  it  cannot  have  a  left  child,  and  y’s  original  right  child
moves into y’s original position, with the rest of y’s original right
subtree  following  automatically.  This  case  is  the  tricky  one
because, as we’ll see, it matters whether y is z’s right child.

The procedure for deleting a given node z from a binary search tree
T  takes  as  arguments  pointers  to  T  and  z.  It  organizes  its  cases  a  bit
differently  from  the  three  cases  outlined  previously  by  considering  the
four cases shown in Figure 12.4.

Figure 12.4 Deleting a node z, in blue, from a binary search tree. Node z may be the root, a left
child of node q, or a right child of q. The node that will replace node z in its position in the tree
is colored orange. (a) Node z has no left child. Replace z by its right child r, which may or may
not be NIL. (b) Node z has a left child l but no right child. Replace z by l. (c) Node z has two
children. Its left child is node l, its right child is its successor y (which has no left child), and y’s
right child is node x. Replace z by y, updating y’s left child to become l, but leaving x as y’s right
child.  (d)  Node  z  has  two  children  (left  child  l  and  right  child  r),  and  its  successor  y  ≠  r  lies
within the subtree rooted at r. First replace y by its own right child x, and set y to be r’s parent.
Then set y to be q’s child and the parent of l.

If z has no left child, then as in part (a) of the ﬁgure, replace z by
its right child, which may or may not be NIL. When z’s right child
is  NIL,  this  case  deals  with  the  situation  in  which  z  has  no
children.  When  z’s  right  child  is  non-NIL,  this  case  handles  the
situation in which z has just one child, which is its right child.

Otherwise, if z has just one child, then that child is a left child. As
in part (b) of the ﬁgure, replace z by its left child.

Otherwise, z has both a left and a right child. Find z’s successor y,
which  lies  in  z’s  right  subtree  and  has  no  left  child  (see  Exercise
12.2-5). Splice node y out of its current location and replace z by
y in the tree. How to do so depends on whether y is z’s right child:

If y is z’s right child, then as in part (c) of the ﬁgure, replace
z by y, leaving y’s right child alone.

Otherwise, y lies within z’s right subtree but is not z’s right
child. In this case, as in part (d) of the ﬁgure, ﬁrst replace y
by its own right child, and then replace z by y.

As  part  of  the  process  of  deleting  a  node,  subtrees  need  to  move
around  within  the  binary  search  tree.  The  subroutine  TRANSPLANT
replaces one subtree as a child of its parent with another subtree. When
TRANSPLANT replaces the subtree rooted at node u with the subtree
rooted  at  node  v,  node  u’s  parent  becomes  node  v’s  parent,  and  u’s
parent ends up having v as its appropriate child. TRANSPLANT allows
v to be NIL instead of a pointer to a node.

TRANSPLANT(T, u, v)
1 if u.p == NIL
T.root = v
2
3 elseif u == u.p.left
u.p.left = v
4
5 else u.p.right = v
6 if v ≠ NIL
7

v.p = u.p

Here  is  how  TRANSPLANT  works.  Lines  1–2  handle  the  case  in
which  u  is  the  root  of  T.  Otherwise,  u  is  either  a  left  child  or  a  right
child of its parent. Lines 3–4 take care of updating u.p.left if u is a left
child, and line 5 updates u.p.right if u is a right child. Because v may be
NIL,  lines  6–7  update  v.p  only  if  v  is  non-NIL.  The  procedure
TRANSPLANT does not attempt to update v.left and v.right. Doing so,
or not doing so, is the responsibility of TRANSPLANT’s caller.

The  procedure  TREE-DELETE  on

facing  page  uses
TRANSPLANT to delete node z from binary search tree T. It executes
the four cases as follows. Lines 1–2 handle the case in which node z has
no  left  child  (Figure  12.4(a)),  and  lines  3–4  handle  the  case  in  which  z
has a left child but no right child (Figure 12.4(b)). Lines 5–12 deal with
the remaining two cases, in which z has two children. Line 5 ﬁnds node
y, which is the successor of z. Because z has a nonempty right subtree,
its  successor  must  be  the  node  in  that  subtree  with  the  smallest  key;
hence the call to TREE-MINIMUM(z.right). As we noted before, y has
no left child. The procedure needs to splice y out of its current location
and replace z by y in the tree. If y is z’s right child (Figure 12.4(c)), then
lines  10–12  replace  z  as  a  child  of  its  parent  by  y  and  replace  y’s  left
child by z’s left child. Node y retains its right child (x in Figure 12.4(c)),
and  so  no  change  to  y.right  needs  to  occur.  If  y  is  not  z’s  right  child
(Figure 12.4(d)), then two nodes have to move. Lines 7–9 replace y as a
child of its parent by y’s right child (x in Figure 12.4(c)) and make z’s
right child (r in the ﬁgure) become y’s right child instead. Finally, lines
10–12 replace z as a child of its parent by y and replace y’s left child by
z’s left child.

Exercises

12.3-1
Give a recursive version of the TREE-INSERT procedure.

12.3-2
Suppose that you construct a binary search tree by repeatedly inserting
distinct values into the tree. Argue that the number of nodes examined
in  searching  for  a  value  in  the  tree  is  1  plus  the  number  of  nodes
examined when the value was ﬁrst inserted into the tree.

12.3-3
You can sort a given set of n numbers by ﬁrst building a binary search
tree  containing  these  numbers  (using  TREE-INSERT  repeatedly  to
insert  the  numbers  one  by  one)  and  then  printing  the  numbers  by  an
inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times
for this sorting algorithm?

12.3-4

When  TREE-DELETE
circumstances can the parameter v of TRANSPLANT be NIL?

12.3-5
Is the operation of deletion “commutative” in the sense that deleting x
and then y from a binary search tree leaves the same tree as deleting y
and then x? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.

12.3-6
Suppose that instead of each node x keeping the attribute x.p, pointing
to x’s parent, it keeps x.succ, pointing to x’s successor. Give pseudocode
for  TREE-SEARCH,  TREE-INSERT,  and  TREE-DELETE  on  a
binary search tree T using this representation. These procedures should
operate  in  O(h)  time,  where  h  is  the  height  of  the  tree  T.  You  may
assume  that  all  keys  in  the  binary  search  tree  are  distinct.  (Hint:  You
might  wish  to  implement  a  subroutine  that  returns  the  parent  of  a
node.)

12.3-7
When  node  z  in  TREE-DELETE  has  two  children,  you  can  choose
node  y  to  be  its  predecessor  rather  than  its  successor.  What  other
changes  to  TREE-DELETE  are  necessary  if  you  do  so?  Some  have
argued  that  a  fair  strategy,  giving  equal  priority  to  predecessor  and
successor,  yields  better  empirical  performance.  How  might  TREE-
DELETE be minimally changed to implement such a fair strategy?

Problems

12-1     Binary search trees with equal keys
Equal  keys  pose  a  problem  for  the  implementation  of  binary  search
trees.

a. What is the asymptotic performance of TREE-INSERT when used
to insert n items with identical keys into an initially empty binary
search tree?

Consider changing TREE-INSERT to test whether z.key = x.key before
line 5 and to test whether z.key = y.key before line 11. If equality holds,
implement  one  of  the  following  strategies.  For  each  strategy,  ﬁnd  the
asymptotic performance of inserting n items with identical keys into an
initially empty binary search tree. (The strategies are described for line
5, which compares the keys of z and x. Substitute y for x to arrive at the
strategies for line 11.)

b. Keep a boolean ﬂag x.b at node x, and set x to either x.left or x.right

based on the value of x.b, which alternates between FALSE and
TRUE each time TREE-INSERT visits x while inserting a node with
the same key as x.

c. Keep a list of nodes with equal keys at x, and insert z into the list.

d. Randomly set x to either x.left or x.right. (Give the worst-case
performance and informally derive the expected running time.)

12-2     Radix trees
Given two strings a = a0a1 … ap and b = b0b1 … bq, where each ai and
each bj belongs to some ordered set of characters, we say that string a is
lexicographically less than string b if either

1. there exists an integer j, where 0 ≤ j ≤ min {p, q}, such that ai = bi

for all i = 0, 1, …, j − 1 and aj < bj, or
2. p < q and ai = bi for all i = 0, 1, …, p.

For  example,  if  a  and  b  are  bit  strings,  then  10100  <  10110  by  rule  1
(letting j = 3) and 10100 < 101000 by rule 2. This ordering is similar to
that used in English-language dictionaries.

The radix tree data structure shown in Figure 12.5 (also known as a
trie) stores the bit strings 1011, 10, 011, 100, and 0. When searching for
a key a = a0a1 … ap, go left at a node of depth i if ai = 0 and right if ai
= 1. Let S be a set of distinct bit strings whose lengths sum to n. Show
how to use a radix tree to sort S lexicographically in Θ(n) time. For the

example in Figure 12.5, the output of the sort should be the sequence 0,
011, 10, 100, 1011.

Figure  12.5  A  radix  tree  storing  the  bit  strings  1011,  10,  011,  100,  and  0.  To  determine  each
node’s key, traverse the simple path from the root to that node. There is no need, therefore, to
store  the  keys  in  the  nodes.  The  keys  appear  here  for  illustrative  purposes  only.  Keys
corresponding to blue nodes are not in the tree. Such nodes are present only to establish a path
to other nodes.

12-3     Average node depth in a randomly built binary search tree

A  randomly  built  binary  search  tree  on  n  keys  is  a  binary  search  tree
created by starting with an empty tree and inserting the keys in random
order, where each of the n! permutations of the keys is equally likely. In
this  problem,  you  will  prove  that  the  average  depth  of  a  node  in  a
randomly built binary search tree with n nodes is O(lg n). The technique
reveals  a  surprising  similarity  between  the  building  of  a  binary  search
tree and the execution of RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT from Section
7.3.

Denote the depth of any node x in tree T by d(x, T). Then the total
path length P(T) of a tree T is the sum, over all nodes x in T, of d(x, T).

a. Argue that the average depth of a node in T is

Thus, you need to show that the expected value of P(T) is O(n lg n).

b. Let TL and TR denote the left and right subtrees of tree T,

respectively. Argue that if T has n nodes, then

P(T) = P(TL) + P(TR) + n − 1.

c. Let P(n) denote the average total path length of a randomly built

binary search tree with n nodes. Show that

d. Show how to rewrite P(n) as

e. Recalling the alternative analysis of the randomized version of
quicksort given in Problem 7-3, conclude that P(n) = O(n lg n).

Each  recursive  invocation  of  randomized  quicksort  chooses  a  random
pivot element to partition the set of elements being sorted. Each node
of  a  binary  search  tree  partitions  the  set  of  elements  that  fall  into  the
subtree rooted at that node.

f. Describe an implementation of quicksort in which the comparisons to

sort a set of elements are exactly the same as the comparisons to
insert the elements into a binary search tree. (The order in which
comparisons are made may differ, but the same comparisons must
occur.)

12-4     Number of different binary trees
Let bn denote the number of different binary trees with n nodes. In this
problem,  you  will  ﬁnd  a  formula  for  bn,  as  well  as  an  asymptotic
estimate.

a. Show that b0 = 1 and that, for n ≥ 1,

b. Referring to Problem 4-5 on page 121 for the deﬁnition of a

generating function, let B(x) be the generating function

Show that B(x) = xB(x)2 + 1, and hence one way to express B(x) in
closed form is

The Taylor expansion of f(x) around the point x = a is given by

where f(k)(x) is the kth derivative of f evaluated at x.

c. Show that

(the  nth  Catalan  number)  by  using  the  Taylor  expansion  of
around x = 0. (If you wish, instead of using the Taylor expansion, you
may  use  the  generalization  of  the  binomial  theorem,  equation  (C.4)
on page 1181, to noninteger exponents n, where for any real number n
 to be n(n − 1) … (n − k +
and for any integer k, you can interpret
1)/k! if k ≥ 0, and 0 otherwise.)

d. Show that

Chapter notes

Knuth [261] contains a good discussion of simple binary search trees as
well  as  many  variations.  Binary  search  trees  seem  to  have  been
independently  discovered  by  a  number  of  people  in  the  late  1950s.
Radix trees are often called “tries,” which comes from the middle letters
in the word retrieval. Knuth [261] also discusses them.

Many texts, including the ﬁrst two editions of this book, describe a
somewhat simpler method of deleting a node from a binary search tree
when both of its children are present. Instead of replacing node z by its
successor y, delete node y but copy its key and satellite data into node z.
The downside of this approach is that the node actually deleted might
not be the node passed to the delete procedure. If other components of
a program maintain pointers to nodes in the tree, they could mistakenly
end up with “stale” pointers to nodes that have been deleted. Although
the deletion method presented in this edition of this book is a bit more
complicated, it guarantees that a call to delete node z deletes node z and
only node z.

Section  14.5  will  show  how  to  construct  an  optimal  binary  search
tree when you know the search frequencies before constructing the tree.
That  is,  given  the  frequencies  of  searching  for  each  key  and  the
frequencies of searching for values that fall between keys in the tree, a
set  of  searches  in  the  constructed  binary  search  tree  examines  the
minimum number of nodes.
