Introduction

This part returns to studying data structures that support operations on
dynamic  sets,  but  at  a  more  advanced  level  than  Part  III.  One  of  the
chapters,  for  example,  makes  extensive  use  of  the  amortized  analysis
techniques from Chapter 16.

Chapter  17  shows  how  to  augment  red-black  trees—adding
additional
in  each  node—to  support  dynamic-set
operations in addition to those covered in Chapters 12 and 13. The ﬁrst
example  augments  red-black  trees  to  dynamically  maintain  order
statistics  for  a  set  of  keys.  Another  example  augments  them  in  a
different way to maintain intervals of real numbers. Chapter 17 includes
a theorem giving sufﬁcient conditions for when a red-black tree can be
augmented  while  maintaining  the  O(lg  n)  running  times  for  insertion
and deletion.

Chapter  18  presents  B-trees,  which  are  balanced  search  trees
speciﬁcally  designed  to  be  stored  on  disks.  Since  disks  operate  much
more slowly than random-access memory, B-tree performance depends

not  only  on  how  much  computing  time  the  dynamic-set  operations
consume but also on how many disk accesses they perform. For each B-
tree operation, the number of disk accesses increases with the height of
the B-tree, but B-tree operations keep the height low.

Chapter 19 examines data structures for disjoint sets. Starting with a
universe  of  n  elements,  each  initially  in  its  own  singleton  set,  the
operation  UNION  unites  two  sets.  At  all  times,  the  n  elements  are
partitioned  into  disjoint  sets,  even  as  calls  to  the  UNION  operation
change  the  members  of  a  set  dynamically.  The  query  FIND-SET
identiﬁes  the  unique  set  that  contains  a  given  element  at  the  moment.
Representing  each  set  as  a  simple  rooted  tree  yields  surprisingly  fast
operations:  a  sequence  of  m  operations  runs  in  O(mα(n))  time,  where
α(n)  is  an  incredibly  slowly  growing  function—α(n)  is  at  most  4  in  any
conceivable  application.  The  amortized  analysis  that  proves  this  time
bound is as complex as the data structure is simple.

The topics covered in this part are by no means the only examples of
“advanced” data structures. Other advanced data structures include the
following:

Fibonacci  heaps  [156]  implement  mergeable  heaps  (see  Problem
10-2 on page 268) with the operations INSERT, MINIMUM, and
UNION  taking  only  O(1)  actual  and  amortized  time,  and  the
operations  EXTRACT-MIN  and  DELETE  taking  O(lg  n)
amortized  time.  The  most  signiﬁcant  advantage  of  these  data
structures,  however,  is  that  DECREASE-KEY  takes  only  O(1)
amortized time. Strict Fibonacci heaps [73], developed later, made
all  of  these  time  bounds  actual.  Because  the  DECREASE-KEY
operation takes constant amortized time, (strict) Fibonacci heaps
constitute key components of some of the asymptotically fastest
algorithms to date for graph problems.

Dynamic trees [415, 429] maintain a forest of disjoint rooted trees.
Each  edge  in  each  tree  has  a  real-valued  cost.  Dynamic  trees
support  queries  to  ﬁnd  parents,  roots,  edge  costs,  and  the
minimum  edge  cost  on  a  simple  path  from  a  node  up  to  a  root.
Trees  may  be  manipulated  by  cutting  edges,  updating  all  edge
costs  on  a  simple  path  from  a  node  up  to  a  root,  linking  a  root

into  another  tree,  and  making  a  node  the  root  of  the  tree  it
appears in. One implementation of dynamic trees gives an O(lg n)
amortized  time  bound  for  each  operation,  while  a  more
implementation  yields  O(lg  n)  worst-case  time
complicated
bounds.  Dynamic  trees  are  used  in  some  of  the  asymptotically
fastest network-ﬂow algorithms.

Splay  trees  [418,  429]  are  a  form  of  binary  search  tree  on  which
the standard search-tree operations run in O(lg n) amortized time.
One application of splay trees simpliﬁes dynamic trees.

Persistent data structures allow queries, and sometimes updates as
well,  on  past  versions  of  a  data  structure.  For  example,  linked
data structures can be made persistent with only a small time and
space  cost  [126].  Problem  13-1  gives  a  simple  example  of  a
persistent dynamic set.

Several  data  structures  allow  a  faster
implementation  of
dictionary  operations  (INSERT,  DELETE,  and  SEARCH)  for  a
restricted  universe  of  keys.  By  taking  advantage  of  these
restrictions, they are able to achieve better worst-case asymptotic
running times than comparison-based data structures. If the keys
are unique integers drawn from the set {0, 1, 2, … , u − 1}, where
u is an exact power of 2, then a recursive data structure known as
a  van  Emde  Boas  tree  [440,  441]  supports  each  of  the  operations
SEARCH,  INSERT,  DELETE,  MINIMUM,  MAXIMUM,
SUCCESSOR,  and  PREDECESSOR  in  O(lg  lg  u)  time.  Fusion
trees  [157]  were  the  ﬁrst  data  structure  to  allow  faster  dictionary
operations  when
integers,
implementing  these  operations  in  O(lg  n/lg  lg  n)  time.  Several
subsequent data structures, including exponential search trees [17],
have also given improved bounds on some or all of the dictionary
operations  and  are  mentioned  in  the  chapter  notes  throughout
this book.

Dynamic  graph  data  structures  support  various  queries  while
allowing  the  structure  of  a  graph  to  change  through  operations
that insert or delete vertices or edges. Examples of the queries that

they  support  include  vertex  connectivity  [214],  edge  connectivity,
minimum  spanning  trees  [213],  biconnectivity,  and  transitive
closure [212].
