148 Chapter 6 (cid:2) Architectural design

Architectural  design  is  concerned  with  understanding  how  a  system  should  be
organized and designing the overall structure of that system. In the model of the soft-
ware development process, as shown in Chapter 2, architectural design is the first
stage  in  the  software  design  process.  It  is  the  critical  link  between  design  and
requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system
and the relationships between them. The output of the architectural design process is
an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of commu-
nicating components.

In agile processes, it is generally accepted that an early stage of the development
process  should  be  concerned  with  establishing  an  overall  system  architecture.
Incremental development of architectures is not usually successful. While refactor-
ing components in response to changes is usually relatively easy, refactoring a sys-
tem architecture is likely to be expensive.

To help you understand what I mean by system architecture, consider Figure 6.1.
This shows an abstract model of the architecture for a packing robot system that
shows the components that have to be developed. This robotic system can pack dif-
ferent kinds of object. It uses a vision component to pick out objects on a conveyor,
identify the type of object, and select the right kind of packaging. The system then
moves objects from the delivery conveyor to be packaged. It places packaged objects
on another conveyor. The architectural model shows these components and the links
between them.

In practice, there is a significant overlap between the processes of requirements
engineering and architectural design. Ideally, a system specification should not
include any design information. This is unrealistic except for very small systems.
Architectural decomposition is usually necessary to structure and organize the spec-
ification. Therefore, as part of the requirements engineering process, you might pro-
pose an abstract system architecture where you associate groups of system functions
or  features  with  large-scale  components  or  sub-systems.  You  can  then  use  this
decomposition to discuss the requirements and features of the system with stake-
holders.

You can design software architectures at two levels of abstraction, which I call

architecture in the small and architecture in the large:

1. Architecture in the small is concerned with the architecture of individual pro-
grams. At this level, we are concerned with the way that an individual program
is decomposed into components. This chapter is mostly concerned with pro-
gram architectures.

2. Architecture in the large is concerned with the architecture of complex enter-
prise systems that include other systems, programs, and program compo-
nents. These enterprise systems are distributed over different computers,
which may be owned and managed by different companies. I cover architec-
ture in the large in Chapters 18 and 19, where I discuss distributed systems
architectures.

Software architecture is important because it affects the performance, robustness,
distributability, and maintainability of a system (Bosch, 2000). As Bosch discusses,
individual components implement the functional system requirements. The non-
functional requirements depend on the system architecture—the way in which these
components  are  organized  and  communicate.  In  many  systems,  non-functional
requirements are also influenced by individual components, but there is no doubt
that the architecture of the system is the dominant influence.

Bass et al. (2003) discuss three advantages of explicitly designing and document-

ing software architecture:

1.

2.

Stakeholder communication The architecture is a high-level presentation of the sys-
tem that may be used as a focus for discussion by a range of different stakeholders.

System analysis Making the system architecture explicit at an early stage in the
system development requires some analysis. Architectural design decisions
have a profound effect on whether or not the system can meet critical require-
ments such as performance, reliability, and maintainability.

3. Large-scale reuse A model of a system architecture is a compact, manageable
description of how a system is organized and how the components interoperate.
The system architecture is often the same for systems with similar requirements
and so can support large-scale software reuse. As I explain in Chapter 16, it may
be possible to develop product-line architectures where the same architecture is
reused across a range of related systems.

150 Chapter 6 (cid:2) Architectural design

Hofmeister et al. (2000) propose that a software architecture can serve firstly as a
design plan for the negotiation of system requirements, and secondly as a means of
structuring discussions with clients, developers, and managers. They also suggest
that it is an essential tool for complexity management. It hides details and allows the
designers to focus on the key system abstractions.

System architectures are often modeled using simple block diagrams, as in Figure 6.1.
Each box in the diagram represents a component. Boxes within boxes indicate that the
component has been decomposed to sub-components. Arrows mean that data and or con-
trol signals are passed from component to component in the direction of the arrows. You
can see many examples of this type of architectural model in Booch’s software architec-
ture catalog (Booch, 2009).

Block diagrams present a high-level picture of the system structure, which people
from different disciplines, who are involved in the system development process, can
readily understand. However, in spite of their widespread use, Bass et al. (2003) dis-
like informal block diagrams for describing an architecture. They claim that these
informal diagrams are poor architectural representations, as they show neither the
type of the relationships among system components nor the components’ externally
visible properties.

The  apparent  contradictions  between  practice  and  architectural  theory  arise

because there are two ways in which an architectural model of a program is used:

1. As  a  way  of  facilitating  discussion  about  the  system  design A  high-level
architectural view of a system is useful for communication with system stake-
holders  and  project  planning  because  it  is  not  cluttered  with  detail.  Stake-
holders can relate to it and understand an abstract view of the system. They
can then discuss the system as a whole without being confused by detail. The
architectural model identifies the key components that are to be developed
so managers  can  start  assigning  people  to  plan  the  development  of  these
systems.

2. As a way of documenting an architecture that has been designed The aim here
is to produce a complete system model that shows the different components in
a system, their interfaces, and their connections. The argument for this is that
such a detailed architectural description makes it easier to understand and evolve
the system.

Block diagrams are an appropriate way of describing the system architecture dur-
ing  the  design  process,  as  they  are  a  good  way  of  supporting  communications
between the people involved in the process. In many projects, these are often the
only architectural documentation that exists. However, if the architecture of a system
is to be thoroughly documented then it is better to use a notation with well-defined
semantics for architectural description. However, as I discuss in Section 6.2, some
people think that detailed documentation is neither useful, nor really worth the cost
of its development.

6.1 (cid:2) Architectural design decisions 151

6.1 Architectural design decisions

Architectural design is a creative process where you design a system organization
that will satisfy the functional and non-functional requirements of a system. Because
it is a creative process, the activities within the process depend on the type of system
being developed, the background and experience of the system architect, and the
specific requirements for the system. It is therefore useful to think of architectural
design as a series of decisions to be made rather than a sequence of activities.

During the architectural design process, system architects have to make a number
of  structural  decisions  that  profoundly  affect  the  system  and  its  development
process. Based on their knowledge and experience, they have to consider the follow-
ing fundamental questions about the system:

1.

Is there a generic application architecture that can act as a template for the sys-
tem that is being designed?

2. How will the system be distributed across a number of cores or processors?

3. What architectural patterns or styles might be used?

4. What will be the fundamental approach used to structure the system?

5. How will the structural components in the system be decomposed into sub-

components?

6. What strategy will be used to control the operation of the components in the system?

7. What architectural organization is best for delivering the non-functional require-

ments of the system?

8. How will the architectural design be evaluated?

9. How should the architecture of the system be documented?

Although  each  software  system  is  unique,  systems  in  the  same  application
domain often have similar architectures that reflect the fundamental concepts of the
domain. For example, application product lines are applications that are built around
a core architecture with variants that satisfy specific customer requirements. When
designing a system architecture, you have to decide what your system and broader
application classes have in common, and decide how much knowledge from these
application architectures you can reuse. I discuss generic application architectures in
Section 6.4 and application product lines in Chapter 16.

For embedded systems and systems designed for personal computers, there is
usually only a single processor and you will not have to design a distributed architec-
ture for the system. However, most large systems are now distributed systems in
which the system software is distributed across many different computers. The
choice of distribution architecture is a key decision that affects the performance and

152 Chapter 6 (cid:2) Architectural design

reliability of the system. This is a major topic in its own right and I cover it sepa-
rately in Chapter 18.

The architecture of a software system may be based on a particular architectural
pattern or style. An architectural pattern is a description of a system organization
(Garlan and Shaw, 1993), such as a client–server organization or a layered architecture.
Architectural patterns capture the essence of an architecture that has been used in dif-
ferent software systems. You should be aware of common patterns, where they can be
used, and their strengths and weaknesses when making decisions about the architec-
ture of a system. I discuss a number of frequently used patterns in Section 6.3.

Garlan and Shaw’s notion of an architectural style (style and pattern have come to
mean the same thing) covers questions 4 to 6 in the previous list. You have to choose
the most appropriate structure, such as client–server or layered structuring, that will
enable you to meet the system requirements. To decompose structural system units,
you decide on the strategy for decomposing components into sub-components. The
approaches that you can use allow different types of architecture to be implemented.
Finally, in the control modeling process, you make decisions about how the execu-
tion of components is controlled. You develop a general model of the control rela-
tionships between the various parts of the system.

Because of the close relationship between non-functional requirements and soft-
ware architecture, the particular architectural style and structure that you choose for
a system should depend on the non-functional system requirements:

1. Performance If performance is a critical requirement, the architecture should
be designed  to  localize  critical  operations  within  a  small  number  of  com-
ponents, with these components all deployed on the same computer rather than
distributed across the network. This may mean using a few relatively large com-
ponents rather than small, fine-grain components, which reduces the number of
component communications. You may also consider run-time system organiza-
tions that allow the system to be replicated and executed on different processors.

2.

3.

Security If security is a critical requirement, a layered structure for the architec-
ture should be used, with the most critical assets protected in the innermost lay-
ers, with a high level of security validation applied to these layers.

Safety If safety is a critical requirement, the architecture should be designed so
that safety-related operations are all located in either a single component or in a
small number of components. This reduces the costs and problems of safety val-
idation and makes it possible to provide related protection systems that can
safely shut down the system in the event of failure.

4. Availability If availability is a critical requirement, the architecture should be
designed to include redundant components so that it is possible to replace and
update components without stopping the system. I describe two fault-tolerant
system architectures for high-availability systems in Chapter 13.

5. Maintainability If maintainability is a critical requirement, the system architec-
ture should be designed using fine-grain, self-contained components that may

6.2 (cid:2) Architectural views 153

readily be changed. Producers of data should be separated from consumers and
shared data structures should be avoided.

Obviously there is potential conflict between some of these architectures. For
example, using large components improves performance and using small, fine-grain
components improves maintainability. If both performance and maintainability are
important system requirements, then some compromise must be found. This can
sometimes be achieved by using different architectural patterns or styles for different
parts of the system.

Evaluating an architectural design is difficult because the true test of an architec-
ture is how well the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements
when it is in use. However, you can do some evaluation by comparing your design
against reference architectures or generic architectural patterns. Bosch’s (2000)
description of the non-functional characteristics of architectural patterns can also be
used to help with architectural evaluation.

6.2 Architectural views

I explained in the introduction to this chapter that architectural models of a software
system can be used to focus discussion about the software requirements or design.
Alternatively, they may be used to document a design so that it can be used as a basis
for more detailed design and implementation, and for the future evolution of the sys-
tem. In this section, I discuss two issues that are relevant to both of these:

1. What views or perspectives are useful when designing and documenting a sys-

tem’s architecture?

2. What notations should be used for describing architectural models?

It is impossible to represent all relevant information about a system’s architecture in
a single architectural model, as each model only shows one view or perspective of the
system. It might show how a system is decomposed into modules, how the run-time
processes interact, or the different ways in which system components are distributed
across a network. All of these are useful at different times so, for both design and doc-
umentation, you usually need to present multiple views of the software architecture.

There are different opinions as to what views are required. Krutchen (1995), in
his well-known 4+1 view model of software architecture, suggests that there should
be four fundamental architectural views, which are related using use cases or scenar-
ios. The views that he suggests are:

1. A logical view, which shows the key abstractions in the system as objects or
object classes. It should be possible to relate the system requirements to entities
in this logical view.

154 Chapter 6 (cid:2) Architectural design

2. A process view, which shows how, at run-time, the system is composed of inter-
acting  processes.  This  view  is  useful  for  making  judgments  about  non-
functional system characteristics such as performance and availability.

3. A development view, which shows how the software is decomposed for devel-
opment, that is, it shows the breakdown of the software into components that are
implemented by a single developer or development team. This view is useful for
software managers and programmers.

4. A physical view, which shows the system hardware and how software compo-
nents are distributed across the processors in the system. This view is useful for
systems engineers planning a system deployment.

Hofmeister et al. (2000) suggest the use of similar views but add to this the notion
of a conceptual view. This view is an abstract view of the system that can be the basis
for decomposing high-level requirements into more detailed specifications, help
engineers  make  decisions  about  components  that  can  be  reused,  and  represent
a product line (discussed in Chapter 16) rather than a single system. Figure 6.1,
which describes the architecture of a packing robot, is an example of a conceptual
system view.

In practice, conceptual views are almost always developed during the design
process and are used to support architectural decision making. They are a way of
communicating the essence of a system to different stakeholders. During the design
process, some of the other views may also be developed when different aspects of
the system are discussed, but there is no need for a complete description from all per-
spectives. It may also be possible to associate architectural patterns, discussed in the
next section, with the different views of a system.

There are differing views about whether or not software architects should use
the UML for architectural description (Clements, et al., 2002). A survey in 2006
(Lange et al., 2006) showed that, when the UML was used, it was mostly applied in
a loose and informal way. The authors of that paper argued that this was a bad thing.
I disagree with this view. The UML was designed for describing object-oriented
systems and, at the architectural design stage, you often want to describe systems at
a higher level of abstraction. Object classes are too close to the implementation to be
useful for architectural description.

I don’t find the UML to be useful during the design process itself and prefer infor-
mal notations that are quicker to write and which can be easily drawn on a white-
board. The UML is of most value when you are documenting an architecture in
detail or using model-driven development, as discussed in Chapter 5.

A number of researchers have proposed the use of more specialized architectural
description languages (ADLs) (Bass et al., 2003) to describe system architectures.
The basic elements of ADLs are components and connectors, and they include rules
and guidelines for well-formed architectures. However, because of their specialized
nature, domain and application specialists find it hard to understand and use ADLs.
This makes it difficult to assess their usefulness for practical software engineering.
ADLs designed for a particular domain (e.g., automobile systems) may be used as a

Advantages

Separates presentation and interaction from the system data. The system is structured into
three logical components that interact with each other. The Model component manages
the system data and associated operations on that data. The View component defines and
manages how the data is presented to the user. The Controller component manages user
interaction (e.g., key presses, mouse clicks, etc.) and passes these interactions to the View
and the Model. See Figure 6.3.

Figure 6.4 shows the architecture of a web-based application system organized using the
MVC pattern.

Used when there are multiple ways to view and interact with data. Also used when the
future requirements for interaction and presentation of data are unknown.

Allows the data to change independently of its representation and vice versa. Supports
presentation of the same data in different ways with changes made in one representation
shown in all of them.

Disadvantages

Can involve additional code and code complexity when the data model and interactions
are simple.

basis for model-driven development. However, I believe that informal models and
notations, such as the UML, will remain the most commonly used ways of docu-
menting system architectures.

Users  of  agile  methods  claim  that  detailed  design  documentation  is  mostly
unused. It is, therefore, a waste of time and money to develop it. I largely agree with
this view and I think that, for most systems, it is not worth developing a detailed
architectural description from these four perspectives. You should develop the views
that are useful for communication and not worry about whether or not your architec-
tural documentation is complete. However, an exception to this is when you are
developing critical systems, when you need to make a detailed dependability analy-
sis of the system. You may need to convince external regulators that your system
conforms to their regulations and so complete architectural documentation may be
required.

6.3 Architectural patterns

The idea of patterns as a way of presenting, sharing, and reusing knowledge about
software systems is now widely used. The trigger for this was the publication of a
book on object-oriented design patterns (Gamma et al., 1995), which prompted the
development of other types of pattern, such as patterns for organizational design
(Coplien and Harrison, 2004), usability patterns (Usability Group, 1998), interaction
(Martin  and  Sommerville,  2004),  configuration  management  (Berczuk  and

the name ‘architectural styles’ (Shaw and Garlan, 1996), with a five-volume series of
handbooks on pattern-oriented software architecture published between 1996 and
2007 (Buschmann et al., 1996; Buschmann et al., 2007a; Buschmann et al., 2007b;
Kircher and Jain, 2004; Schmidt et al., 2000).

In this section, I introduce architectural patterns and briefly describe a selection
of architectural patterns that are commonly used in different types of systems. For
more information about patterns and their use, you should refer to published pattern
handbooks.

You can think of an architectural pattern as a stylized, abstract description of good
practice, which has been tried and tested in different systems and environments. So,
an architectural pattern should describe a system organization that has been success-
ful in previous systems. It should include information of when it is and is not appro-
priate to use that pattern, and the pattern’s strengths and weaknesses.

For example, Figure 6.2 describes the well-known Model-View-Controller pattern.
This pattern is the basis of interaction management in many web-based systems. The
stylized pattern description includes the pattern name, a brief description (with an
associated graphical model), and an example of the type of system where the pattern
is used (again, perhaps with a graphical model). You should also include information
about  when  the  pattern  should  be  used  and  its  advantages  and  disadvantages.
Graphical models of the architecture associated with the MVC pattern are shown in
Figures 6.3 and 6.4. These present the architecture from different views—Figure 6.3
is a conceptual view and Figure 6.4 shows a possible run-time architecture when this
pattern is used for interaction management in a web-based system.

In a short section of a general chapter, it is impossible to describe all of the
generic patterns that can be used in software development. Rather, I present some
selected examples of patterns that are widely used and which capture good architec-
tural design principles. I have included some further examples of generic architec-
tural patterns on the book’s web pages.

6.3.1 Layered architecture

The notions of separation and independence are fundamental to architectural design
because they allow changes to be localized. The MVC pattern, shown in Figure 6.2,
separates elements of a system, allowing them to change independently. For exam-
ple,  adding  a  new  view  or  changing  an  existing  view  can  be  done  without  any
changes to the underlying data in the model. The layered architecture pattern is
another way of achieving separation and independence. This pattern is shown in
Figure 6.5. Here, the system functionality is organized into separate layers, and each
layer only relies on the facilities and services offered by the layer immediately
beneath it.

This layered approach supports the incremental development of systems. As a
layer is developed, some of the services provided by that layer may be made avail-
able to users. The architecture is also changeable and portable. So long as its inter-
face is unchanged, a layer can be replaced by another, equivalent layer. Furthermore,
when layer interfaces change or new facilities are added to a layer, only the adjacent
layer is affected. As layered systems localize machine dependencies in inner layers,
this makes it easier to provide multi-platform implementations of an application sys-
tem. Only the inner, machine-dependent layers need be re-implemented to take
account of the facilities of a different operating system or database.

Figure 6.6 is an example of a layered architecture with four layers. The lowest
layer includes system support software—typically database and operating system
support.  The  next  layer  is  the  application  layer  that  includes  the  components
concerned with the application functionality and utility components that are used
by other application components. The third layer is concerned with user interface

Description

Advantages

Organizes the system into layers with related functionality associated with each layer.
A layer provides services to the layer above it so the lowest-level layers represent core
services that are likely to be used throughout the system. See Figure 6.6.

A layered model of a system for sharing copyright documents held in different libraries, as
shown in Figure 6.7.

Used when building new facilities on top of existing systems; when the development is
spread across several teams with each team responsibility for a layer of functionality; when
there is a requirement for multi-level security.

Allows replacement of entire layers so long as the interface is maintained. Redundant
facilities (e.g., authentication) can be provided in each layer to increase the dependability
of the system.

Disadvantages

In practice, providing a clean separation between layers is often difficult and a high-level
layer may have to interact directly with lower-level layers rather than through the layer
immediately below it. Performance can be a problem because of multiple levels of
interpretation of a service request as it is processed at each layer.

management and providing user authentication and authorization, with the top layer
providing user interface facilities. Of course, the number of layers is arbitrary. Any
of the layers in Figure 6.6 could be split into two or more layers.

Figure 6.7 is an example of how this layered architecture pattern can be applied to a
library system called LIBSYS, which allows controlled electronic access to copyright
material from a group of university libraries. This has a five-layer architecture, with the
bottom layer being the individual databases in each library.

You can see another example of the layered architecture pattern in Figure 6.17
(found in Section 6.4). This shows the organization of the system for mental health-
care (MHC-PMS) that I have discussed in earlier chapters.

6.3.2 Repository architecture

The layered architecture and MVC patterns are examples of patterns where the view
presented  is  the  conceptual  organization  of  a  system.  My  next  example,  the
Repository pattern (Figure 6.8), describes how a set of interacting components can
share data.

The majority of systems that use large amounts of data are organized around a
shared database or repository. This model is therefore suited to applications in which

Description

Example

When used

Advantages

All data in a system is managed in a central repository that is accessible to all system
components. Components do not interact directly, only through the repository.

Figure 6.9 is an example of an IDE where the components use
a repository of system design information. Each software tool generates information which
is then available for use by other tools.

You should use this pattern when you have a system in which large volumes of
information are generated that has to be stored for a long time. You may also use it in
data-driven systems where the inclusion of data in the repository triggers an action
or tool.

Components can be independent—they do not need to know of the existence of other
components. Changes made by one component can be propagated to all components. All
data can be managed consistently (e.g., backups done at the same time) as it is all in one
place.

Disadvantages

The repository is a single point of failure so problems in the repository affect the whole
system. May be inefficiencies in organizing all communication through the repository.
Distributing the repository across several computers may be difficult.

data is generated by one component and used by another. Examples of this type of
system include command and control systems, management information systems,
CAD systems, and interactive development environments for software.

Figure 6.9 is an illustration of a situation in which a repository might be used.
This diagram shows an IDE that includes different tools to support model-driven
development. The repository in this case might be a version-controlled environment
(as discussed in Chapter 25) that keeps track of changes to software and allows roll-
back to earlier versions.

Organizing tools around a repository is an efficient way to share large amounts of
data. There is no need to transmit data explicitly from one component to another.
However,  components  must  operate  around  an  agreed  repository  data  model.
Inevitably, this is a compromise between the specific needs of each tool and it may
be difficult or impossible to integrate new components if their data models do not fit
the agreed schema. In practice, it may be difficult to distribute the repository over a
number of machines. Although it is possible to distribute a logically centralized
repository, there may be problems with data redundancy and inconsistency.

In the example shown in Figure 6.9, the repository is passive and control is the
responsibility of the components using the repository. An alternative approach,
which has been derived for AI systems, uses a ‘blackboard’ model that triggers com-
ponents when particular data become available. This is appropriate when the form of
the repository data is less well structured. Decisions about which tool to activate can
only be made when the data has been analyzed. This model is introduced by Nii
(1986). Bosch (2000) includes a good discussion of how this style relates to system
quality attributes.

6.3.3 Client–server architecture

The repository pattern is concerned with the static structure of a system and does not
show its run-time organization. My next example illustrates a very commonly used
run-time organization for distributed systems. The Client–server pattern is described
in Figure 6.10.

with each service delivered from a separate server. Clients are users of these services and
access servers to make use of them.

Figure 6.11 is an example of a film and video/DVD library organized as a client–server
system.

Used when data in a shared database has to be accessed from a range of locations.
Because servers can be replicated, may also be used when the load on a system is
variable.

The principal advantage of this model is that servers can be distributed across a network.
General functionality (e.g., a printing service) can be available to all clients and does not
need to be implemented by all services.

Disadvantages

Each service is a single point of failure so susceptible to denial of service attacks or
server failure. Performance may be unpredictable because it depends on the network
as well as the system. May be management problems if servers are owned by different
organizations.

Figure 6.10 The
client–server pattern

A system that follows the client–server pattern is organized as a set of services
and associated servers, and clients that access and use the services. The major com-
ponents of this model are:

1. A set of servers that offer services to other components. Examples of servers
include print servers that offer printing services, file servers that offer file man-
agement services, and a compile server, which offers programming language
compilation services.

2. A set of clients that call on the services offered by servers. There will normally
be several instances of a client program executing concurrently on different
computers.

3. A network that allows the clients to access these services. Most client–server
systems  are  implemented  as  distributed  systems,  connected  using  Internet
protocols.

Client–server architectures are usually thought of as distributed systems architec-
tures but the logical model of independent services running on separate servers can
be implemented on a single computer. Again, an important benefit is separation and
independence. Services and servers can be changed without affecting other parts of
the system.

Clients may have to know the names of the available servers and the services that
they provide. However, servers do not need to know the identity of clients or how
many clients are accessing their services. Clients access the services provided by a
server through remote procedure calls using a request-reply protocol such as the http

protocol used in the WWW. Essentially, a client makes a request to a server and
waits until it receives a reply.

Figure 6.11 is an example of a system that is based on the client–server model. This
is a multi-user, web-based system for providing a film and photograph library. In this
system, several servers manage and display the different types of media. Video frames
need to be transmitted quickly and in synchrony but at relatively low resolution. They
may be compressed in a store, so the video server can handle video compression and
decompression in different formats. Still pictures, however, must be maintained at a
high resolution, so it is appropriate to maintain them on a separate server.

The catalog must be able to deal with a variety of queries and provide links into
the web information system that includes data about the film and video clips, and an
e-commerce system that supports the sale of photographs, film, and video clips. The

Description

The processing of the data in a system is organized so that each processing component
(filter) is discrete and carries out one type of data transformation. The data flows (as in a
pipe) from one component to another for processing.

Example

Figure 6.13 is an example of a pipe and filter system used for processing invoices.

Advantages

Disadvantages

Commonly used in data processing applications (both batch- and transaction-based)
where inputs are processed in separate stages to generate related outputs.

Easy to understand and supports transformation reuse. Workflow style matches the
structure of many business processes. Evolution by adding transformations is
straightforward. Can be implemented as either a sequential or concurrent system.

The format for data transfer has to be agreed upon between communicating
transformations. Each transformation must parse its input and unparse its output to the
agreed form. This increases system overhead and may mean that it is impossible to reuse
functional transformations that use incompatible data structures.

The most important advantage of the client–server model is that it is a distributed
architecture. Effective use can be made of networked systems with many distributed
processors. It is easy to add a new server and integrate it with the rest of the system
or to upgrade servers transparently without affecting other parts of the system.
I discuss distributed architectures, including client–server architectures and distrib-
uted object architectures, in Chapter 18.

6.3.4 Pipe and filter architecture

My final example of an architectural pattern is the pipe and filter pattern. This is a
model of the run-time organization of a system where functional transformations
process their inputs and produce outputs. Data flows from one to another and is trans-
formed as it moves through the sequence. Each processing step is implemented as a
transform. Input data flows through these transforms until converted to output. The
transformations may execute sequentially or in parallel. The data can be processed by
each transform item by item or in a single batch.

The name ‘pipe and filter’ comes from the original Unix system where it was pos-
sible to link processes using ‘pipes’. These passed a text stream from one process to
another. Systems that conform to this model can be implemented by combining Unix
commands, using pipes and the control facilities of the Unix shell. The term ‘filter’
is used because a transformation ‘filters out’ the data it can process from its input
data stream.

Variants of this pattern have been in use since computers were first used for auto-
matic data processing. When transformations are sequential with data processed in
batches, this pipe and filter architectural model becomes a batch sequential model, a
common architecture for data processing systems (e.g., a billing system). The archi-
tecture of an embedded system may also be organized as a process pipeline, with
each process executing concurrently. I discuss the use of this pattern in embedded
systems in Chapter 20.

An example of this type of system architecture, used in a batch processing appli-
cation, is shown in Figure 6.13. An organization has issued invoices to customers.
Once a week, payments that have been made are reconciled with the invoices. For

164 Chapter 6 (cid:2) Architectural design

Architectural patterns for control

There are specific architectural patterns that reflect commonly used ways of organizing control in a system.
These include centralized control, based on one component calling other components, and event-based control,
where the system reacts to external events.

those invoices that have been paid, a receipt is issued. For those invoices that have
not been paid within the allowed payment time, a reminder is issued.

Interactive systems are difficult to write using the pipe and filter model because
of the need for a stream of data to be processed. Although simple textual input
and output can be modeled in this way, graphical user interfaces have more complex
I/O formats and a control strategy that is based on events such as mouse clicks or
menu selections. It is difficult to translate this into a form compatible with the
pipelining model.

6.4 Application architectures

Application systems are intended to meet a business or organizational need. All busi-
nesses  have  much  in  common—they  need  to  hire  people,  issue  invoices,  keep
accounts, and so on. Businesses operating in the same sector use common sector-
specific applications. Therefore, as well as general business functions, all phone
companies  need  systems  to  connect  calls,  manage  their  network,  issue  bills  to
customers, etc. Consequently, the application systems used by these businesses also
have much in common.

These commonalities have led to the development of  software architectures
that describe the structure and organization of particular types of software sys-
tems. Application architectures encapsulate the principal characteristics of a
class of systems. For example, in real-time systems, there might be generic archi-
tectural models of different system types, such as data collection systems or
monitoring systems. Although instances of these systems differ in detail, the
common architectural structure can be reused when developing new systems of
the same type.

The  application  architecture  may  be  re-implemented  when  developing  new
systems but, for many business systems, application reuse is possible without re-
implementation. We see this in the growth of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
systems from companies such as SAP and Oracle, and vertical software packages
(COTS) for specialized applications in different areas of business. In these systems,
a generic system is configured and adapted to create a specific business application.

6.4 (cid:2) Application architectures 165

Application architectures

There are several examples of application architectures on the book’s website. These include descriptions of
batch data-processing systems, resource allocation systems, and event-based editing systems.

http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Architecture/AppArch/

For example, a system for supply chain management can be adapted for different
types of suppliers, goods, and contractual arrangements.

As a software designer, you can use models of application architectures in a num-

ber of ways:

1. As a starting point for the architectural design process If you are unfamiliar with
the type of application that you are developing, you can base your initial design
on a generic application architecture. Of course, this will have to be specialized
for the specific system being developed, but it is a good starting point for design.

2. As a design checklist If you have developed an architectural design for an appli-
cation system, you can compare this with the generic application architecture.
You can check that your design is consistent with the generic architecture.

3. As a way of organizing the work of the development team The application archi-
tectures identify stable structural features of the system architectures and in
many cases, it is possible to develop these in parallel. You can assign work to
group members to implement different components within the architecture.

4. As a means of assessing components for reuse If you have components you
might be able to reuse, you can compare these with the generic structures to see
whether there are comparable components in the application architecture.

5. As a vocabulary for talking about types of applications If you are discussing a spe-
cific application or trying to compare applications of the same types, then you can
use the concepts identified in the generic architecture to talk about the applications.

There are many types of application system and, in some cases, they may seem to
be very different. However, many of these superficially dissimilar applications actu-
ally have much in common, and thus can be represented by a single abstract applica-
tion architecture. I illustrate this here by describing the following architectures of
two types of application:

1. Transaction processing applications Transaction processing applications are
database-centered applications that process user requests for information and
update the information in a database. These are the most common type of inter-
active business systems. They are organized in such a way that user actions can’t
interfere with each other and the integrity of the database is maintained. This

class of system includes interactive banking systems, e-commerce systems,
information systems, and booking systems.

2. Language processing systems Language processing systems are systems in
which the user’s intentions are expressed in a formal language (such as Java).
The language processing system processes this language into an internal format
and then interprets this internal representation. The best-known language pro-
cessing systems are compilers, which translate high-level language programs
into machine code. However, language processing systems are also used to
interpret  command  languages  for  databases  and  information  systems,  and
markup languages such as XML (Harold and Means, 2002; Hunter et al., 2007).

I have chosen these particular types of system because a large number of web-
based business systems are transaction-processing systems, and all software devel-
opment relies on language processing systems.

6.4.1

Transaction processing systems

Transaction processing (TP) systems are designed to process user requests for infor-
mation  from  a  database,  or  requests  to  update  a  database  (Lewis  et  al.,  2003).
Technically, a database transaction is sequence of operations that is treated as a sin-
gle unit (an atomic unit). All of the operations in a transaction have to be completed
before the database changes are made permanent. This ensures that failure of opera-
tions within the transaction does not lead to inconsistencies in the database.

From a user perspective, a transaction is any coherent sequence of operations that
satisfies a goal, such as ‘find the times of flights from London to Paris’. If the user
transaction does not require the database to be changed then it may not be necessary
to package this as a technical database transaction.

An example of a transaction is a customer request to withdraw money from a bank
account using an ATM. This involves getting details of the customer’s account, check-
ing the balance, modifying the balance by the amount withdrawn, and sending com-
mands to the ATM to deliver the cash. Until all of these steps have been completed, the
transaction is incomplete and the customer accounts database is not changed.

Transaction processing systems are usually interactive systems in which users
make asynchronous requests for service. Figure 6.14 illustrates the conceptual ar-
chitectural structure of TP applications. First a user makes a request to the system
through an I/O processing component. The request is processed by some application-
specific logic. A transaction is created and passed to a transaction manager, which is
usually embedded in the database management system. After the transaction manager

has ensured that the transaction is properly completed, it signals to the application
that processing has finished.

Transaction processing systems may be organized as a ‘pipe and filter’ architec-
ture with system components responsible for input, processing, and output. For
example, consider a banking system that allows customers to query their accounts
and withdraw cash from an ATM. The system is composed of two cooperating soft-
ware components—the ATM software and the account processing software in the
bank’s database server. The input and output components are implemented as soft-
ware in the ATM and the processing component is part of the bank’s database server.
Figure 6.15 shows the architecture of this system, illustrating the functions of the
input, process, and output components.

6.4.2 Information systems

All systems that involve interaction with a shared database can be considered to be
transaction-based information systems. An information system allows controlled
access to a large base of information, such as a library catalog, a flight timetable, or
the records of patients in a hospital. Increasingly, information systems are web-based
systems that are accessed through a web browser.

Figure 6.16 a very general model of an information system. The system is mod-
eled using a layered approach (discussed in Section 6.3) where the top layer supports
the user interface and the bottom layer is the system database. The user communica-
tions layer handles all input and output from the user interface, and the information
retrieval layer includes application-specific logic for accessing and updating the
database. As we shall see later, the layers in this model can map directly onto servers
in an Internet-based system.

As an example of an instantiation of this layered model, Figure 6.17 shows the
architecture of the MHC-PMS. Recall that this system maintains and manages details
of patients who are consulting specialist doctors about mental health problems. I have

added detail to each layer in the model by identifying the components that support
user communications and information retrieval and access:

1. The top layer is responsible for implementing the user interface. In this case, the

UI has been implemented using a web browser.

2. The second layer provides the user interface functionality that is delivered
through the web browser. It includes components to allow users to log in to the
system and checking components that ensure that the operations they use are
allowed by their role. This layer includes form and menu management compo-
nents that present information to users, and data validation components that
check information consistency.

3. The third layer implements the functionality of the system and provides compo-
nents that implement system security, patient information creation and updating,
import and export of patient data from other databases, and report generators
that create management reports.

4. Finally, the lowest layer, which is built using a commercial database manage-
ment system, provides transaction management and persistent data storage.

Information and resource management systems are now usually web-based systems
where  the  user  interfaces  are  implemented  using  a  web  browser.  For  example,
e-commerce systems are Internet-based resource management systems that accept elec-
tronic orders for goods or services and then arrange delivery of these goods or services
to the customer. In an e-commerce system, the application-specific layer includes addi-
tional functionality supporting a ‘shopping cart’ in which users can place a number of
items in separate transactions, then pay for them all together in a single transaction.

The  organization  of  servers  in  these  systems  usually  reflects  the  four-layer
generic model presented in Figure 6.16. These systems are often implemented as
multi-tier client server/architectures, as discussed in Chapter 18:

1. The web server is responsible for all user communications, with the user inter-

face implemented using a web browser;

2. The application server is responsible for implementing application-specific

logic as well as information storage and retrieval requests;

3. The database server moves information to and from the database and handles

transaction management.

Using multiple servers allows high throughput and makes it possible to handle
hundreds of transactions per minute. As demand increases, servers can be added at
each level to cope with the extra processing involved.

6.4.3 Language processing systems

Language processing systems translate a natural or artificial language into another
representation of that language and, for programming languages, may also execute
the resulting code. In software engineering, compilers translate an artificial program-
ming language into machine code. Other language-processing systems may translate
an XML data description into commands to query a database or to an alternative
XML representation. Natural language processing systems may translate one natural
language to another e.g., French to Norwegian.

A possible architecture for a language processing system for a programming lan-
guage is illustrated in Figure 6.18. The source language instructions define the pro-
gram to be executed and a translator converts these into instructions for an abstract
machine. These instructions are then interpreted by another component that fetches
the instructions for execution and executes them using (if necessary) data from the
environment. The output of the process is the result of interpreting the instructions
on the input data.

Of course, for many compilers, the interpreter is a hardware unit that processes
machine instructions and the abstract machine is a real processor. However, for
dynamically typed languages, such as Python, the interpreter may be a software
component.

Programming language compilers that are part of a more general programming
environment have a generic architecture (Figure 6.19) that includes the following
components:

1. A lexical analyzer, which takes input language tokens and converts them to an

internal form.

2. A symbol table, which holds information about the names of entities (variables,

class names, object names, etc.) used in the text that is being translated.

3. A syntax analyzer, which checks the syntax of the language being translated. It

uses a defined grammar of the language and builds a syntax tree.

4. A syntax tree, which is an internal structure representing the program being

compiled.

Reference architectures

Reference architectures capture important features of system architectures in a domain. Essentially, they include
everything that might be in an application architecture although, in reality, it is very unlikely that any individual
application would include all the features shown in a reference architecture. The main purpose of reference
architectures is to evaluate and compare design proposals, and to educate people about architectural
characteristics in that domain.

http://www.SoftwareEngineering-9.com/Web/Architecture/RefArch.html

5. A semantic analyzer that uses information from the syntax tree and the symbol

table to check the semantic correctness of the input language text.

6. A code generator that ‘walks’ the syntax tree and generates abstract machine code.

Other components might also be included which analyze and transform the syn-
tax tree to improve efficiency and remove redundancy from the generated machine
code. In other types of language processing system, such as a natural language trans-
lator, there will be additional components such as a dictionary, and the generated
code is actually the input text translated into another language.

There are alternative architectural patterns that may be used in a language pro-
cessing system (Garlan and Shaw, 1993). Compilers can be implemented using a
composite of a repository and a pipe and filter model. In a compiler architecture, the
symbol table is a repository for shared data. The phases of lexical, syntactic, and
semantic analysis are organized sequentially, as shown in Figure 6.19, and commu-
nicate through the shared symbol table.

This pipe and filter model of language compilation is effective in batch environ-
ments where programs are compiled and executed without user interaction; for
example, in the translation of one XML document to another. It is less effective
when a compiler is integrated with other language processing tools such as a struc-
tured editing system, an interactive debugger or a program prettyprinter. In this
situation, changes from one component need to be reflected immediately in other
components. It is better, therefore, to organize the system around a repository, as
shown in Figure 6.20.

This figure illustrates how a language processing system can be part of an integrated
set of programming support tools. In this example, the symbol table and syntax tree act
as a central information repository. Tools or tool fragments communicate through it.
Other information that is sometimes embedded in tools, such as the grammar definition
and the definition of the output format for the program, have been taken out of the tools
and put into the repository. Therefore, a syntax-directed editor can check that the syntax
of a program is correct as it is being typed and a prettyprinter can create listings of the
program in a format that is easy to read.
